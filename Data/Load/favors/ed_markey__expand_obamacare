Edward John "Ed" Markey (born July 11, 1946) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who is the junior United States Senator from Massachusetts, in office since 2013. From 1976 to 2013 he served as the U.S. Representative for Massachusetts's 5th congressional district. He previously served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1973 to 1976.
Markey is a liberal who has focused on energy policy and was Chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming from 2007 to 2011. In 2013, after John Kerry was appointed United States Secretary of State, he was elected to serve out the balance of Kerry's sixth Senate term in a 2013 special election. Markey defeated socially conservative Stephen Lynch in the Democratic primary and Republican Gabriel E. Gomez in the general election. When he left the House, he was its eighth most senior member. In 2014 Markey was elected to a full six-year Senate term. He is the dean of the Massachusetts congressional delegation and the second longest-serving current member of Congress from New England, behind Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Markey was born on July 11, 1946, in Malden, Massachusetts, the son of Christina M. (née Courtney) and John E. Markey, a milkman. The family was Irish Catholic, and Markey was educated at Immaculate Conception School and Malden Catholic High School. He graduated from Boston College in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts, and from Boston College Law School in 1972 with a Juris Doctor. After graduating, Markey worked as a lawyer in private practice.
Markey served in the United States Army Reserve from 1968 to 1973, attaining the rank of Specialist Fourth Class. He joined while a junior in college, and has stated that he enlisted before receiving a Vietnam War draft notice. He further stated that even though he opposed the war, if he had been drafted without having secured a position in the Reserve, he would have answered the induction notice and gone to Vietnam. Ed Markey's South Boston unit included Thomas P. O'Neill III, Steve Grossman, and Markey's brothers Richard and John. Markey was discharged in 1973, a year before his enlistment agreement was due to expire, which was not unusual as the military discharged many members early during post-Vietnam force drawdowns.
Markey was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he represented the 16th Middlesex district (Malden and Melrose) from 1973 to 1976.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===

On May 21, 1976, incumbent Congressman Torbert Macdonald died in office. Markey, who had just been elected to a third term in the state house, entered a seven-candidate Democratic primary for what was then the 7th District In the primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—Markey won the nomination with a plurality of 22% of the vote. In the November 1976 election, he defeated Republican Richard Daly 77-18%. That election also doubled as a special election for the balance of Macdonald's term, and so Markey took office later that night. This gave him greater seniority than other Representatives elected in 1976.
Markey has been challenged in a Democratic primary 3 times; in 1980 when he won 85%, in 1984 when he won 54%, and in 2002 when he won 85%.
Markey was re-elected 19 more times from this district, which included most of the northern suburbs of Boston. His lowest vote total was 62% in 1992, in a three-way election. Markey faced no Republican opposition in his bids for re-election 8 times, in 1978, 1980, 1986–90, 2000, 2002, and 2006. His district was renumbered the 5th after the 2010 census, in which Massachusetts lost a district.


=== Tenure ===

Markey was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the National Journal gave him a "Composite Liberal" score of 89.2.
Braintree Mayor Joseph C. Sullivan praised him as "a fine congressman."


==== Environment and energy ====
In December 2007, Markey became the first US politician to use Second Life, through which he addressed the delegates of the UNFCCC in Bali as part of OneClimate's Virtual Bali event. It was estimated that the carbon dioxide he saved by not flying to Bali was around 5.5 tons. Pressure from Markey prompted BP to provide a live underwater video feed showing oil leaking out of a pipe in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Markey has been a longtime critic of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and has been critical of the NRC's decision-making on the proposed Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design and the NRC response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.
In 2011, Markey criticized Republicans and the Tea Party movement, saying "Rick Perry and these other guys are allergic to science...too many of the tea party people, who basically don’t believe in science, are now controlling the Republican Party." In reply to Alaska's Governor Sarah Palin's position on how the American Clean Energy and Security Act (also known as Waxman-Markey, named after Markey and Henry Waxman) could have a negative impact for Alaskans, Markey wrote an article criticizing Palin's inaction on global warming and her environmental positions.
Markey sarcastically suggested in August 2010 that global warming deniers form their own country on an iceberg: “An iceberg four times the size of Manhattan has broken off Greenland, creating plenty of room for global warming deniers to start their own country.” Markey also said that, at the time, 2010 was the hottest recorded year, and "scientists agree arctic ice is a canary in a coal mine that provides clear warnings on climate”. Markey has derided Republicans' stance on global warming, stating during a hearing: "I won’t physically rise, because I’m worried that Republicans will overturn the law of gravity, sending us floating about the room.”
In January 2011, House Republicans eliminated the Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming, which Nancy Pelosi created in 2006 and Markey chaired.


==== Domestic issues ====
Markey was one of the 31 members of the House who voted not to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 Presidential election; without Ohio's votes John Kerry would have been elected President.
Markey introduced legislation to change the duration of Daylight Saving Time and to increasing privacy controls over children online.
Markey drew some controversy through his proposal to introduce legislation that deals with amusement parks' roller coasters, believing that newer, faster rides that exert greater G-pressures on the human body are dangerous mentally and physically, despite a lack of concrete evidence to support these claims, and contrary to studies that affirmed the safety of roller coasters in general.
As a Representative in 2009, Markey sponsored the Internet Freedom Preservation Act to enact principles of net neutrality. The proposed legislation received support from a few dozen co-sponsors and public interest organizations but ultimately died in committee before enactment.


==== National defense ====
In 2003, Markey called attention to the lack of security surrounding air cargo placed on commercial passenger planes, arguing that if passenger baggage is screened for explosive devices, cargo on the plane should be as well. In 2007, he succeeded in getting a 100 percent air cargo screening requirement signed into law. In the law codifying the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, Markey wrote the mandate requiring all cargo on passenger planes to be screened.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
Subcommittee on Energy and Power
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations

Committee on Natural Resources (Ranking Member)
As Ranking Member, Markey served as an ex officio member on all Subcommittees


== U.S. Senate ==
In 2004, Markey was considered a contender for John Kerry's seat in the United States Senate if Kerry were to be elected President of the United States. Markey was considered a leading contender in the 2010 special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy, but on September 12, 2009, he announced his decision not to run and endorsed fellow Congressman Michael Capuano, who went on to lose the Democratic primary to Martha Coakley.


=== 2013 special election ===

On December 27, 2012, Markey was the first to announce his candidacy to run in a special election to fill Kerry's seat after Barack Obama nominated him for United States Secretary of State. Several politicians, including Kerry, endorsed Markey even before the Senate confirmed Kerry. On April 30, 2013, Markey won the Democratic nomination by defeating fellow Congressman Stephen Lynch in the primary election. He defeated Republican challenger Gabriel E. Gomez in the general special election on June 25 and completed the remaining 17 months of Kerry's term.
Markey is the longest tenured House member ever elected to the Senate, with his 36-plus years of service exceeding that of Frederick H. Gillett, who served in the House for 32 years before moving to the upper chamber in 1925. Markey is the 11th oldest candidate to win a U.S. Senate special election out of more than 170 men and women since the passage of the 17th Amendment.


=== Tenure ===

Markey resigned his House seat on July 15, 2013 and was sworn into the Senate on July 16. Although he is the dean of the Massachusetts delegation, he is the state's junior Senator, alongside Elizabeth Warren.
Markey is known for the "blizzard" of public letters he posts on his website and sends to the press to draw attention to his favored issues.

**VoteMatch**   
  
**Expand ObamaCare**

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support ** means you believe: Too few Americans have adequate health insurance. The government should make funds available for more complete coverage, or should expand existing government-run coverage to all citizens. A single-payer system would solve most healthcare problems. 
  * **Support** means you believe: The government should provide coverage or subsidize health insurance for at-risk groups such as children and the elderly. Society benefits when more people are covered. Universal health insurance is a good goal, although some market methods can work as well as government systems. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: While more thorough health coverage is a noble idea, further health coverage should be promoted through non-government means. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Nationalized health care would entail a government takeover of a large portion of the economy and undue intrusions into our personal medical histories.  Remove the federal government from the health care industry. 

This question is looking for your views on how large a role the federal
government should play in the health care industry.  However you answer the
above question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Single-payer universal coverage 
  * Insure the millions of uninsured Americans 
  * Require coverage of all children 
  * Supported Obama's "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act" (PPACA)
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of single-payer government-run healthcare. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** progress toward universal health coverage. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe in **practical** progress towards healthcare availability via the free market. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** that government should not be involved with providing healthcare. 

**    
BACKGROUND**

**OBAMACARE**

  * **_ObamaCare**_ refers to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010, which reformed healthcare insurance with the goal of near-universal coverage. 

  * Critics refer to ObamaCare as **_socialized medicine**_ \-- which could mean the government runs the healthcare system, as in the United Kingdom, but more accurately in the United States means that the federal government mandates individual health coverage. 

  * **_Individual Mandate**_: The crux of the opposition to ObamaCare is whether the federal government can mandate that individuals purchase health insurance -- that will be tested in a Supreme Court case late in 2012. 

  * **_RomneyCare**_ refers to the Massachusetts state version of mandated healthcare initiated under Gov. Mitt Romney -- its principal difference being a STATE mandate instead of a FEDERAL mandate. 

  * Opponents of ObamaCare suggest replacing it with the following list of reforms: cross-state purchasing; tort reform; Health Savings Accounts; small business pooling; and transparency for better patient choice. 

  * **_Tort Reform**_ refers to changing the rules about civil litigation, typically to cap damage awards. In a political context, it usually applies to medical malpractice lawsuits, but in a legal context, it also applies to personal injury and product liability lawsuits. The term "tort" means "at fault;" when a doctor is found at fault, a jury can currently award unlimited damages. Awards in the millions of dollars put upward pressure on malpractice insurance rates; hence many conservatives favor tort reform as a means to reduce healthcare costs. Proposed solutions include capping lawsuit compensation or restricting "frivolous lawsuits." Trial lawyers--the recipients of legal fees from tort awards--heavily favor Democratic candidates, so Republicans would like to limit their legal fees. 

  * The Supreme Court decided the case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius on June 28, 2012, on the constitutionality of ObamaCares individual mandate. Justices Roberts and Kennedy were very skeptical that the mandate was justified under the commerce clause. But the governments lawyer made a strong case for the governments taxing powerthat argument eventually won the daybecause the mandate would be administered by the Internal Revenue Service, paid on your Form 1040 on April 15th. The president had argued that the mandate was not a tax; the court decided it was.  
**HMOs & MANAGED CARE**

  * Prior to ObamaCare, comprehensive national health care reform had died in Congress in 1994 (after a report by a commission run by Hillary Clinton, hence the moniker "HillaryCare"). 
  * 16% of Americans (42 million people) have no health insurance (and hence must pay for health services in full, or receive hospital charity). 
  * 14% of Americans receive some form of public health care or health insurance (70% have private health insurance). 
  * 20% of Americans are members of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). 
**PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS**

Congress and the Presidential candidates are debating a Patients Bill of
Rights which would establish rules of dealing with HMO managed care. The
buzzwords in this debate are:

  * **_External Appeal: **_Patients cannot currently appeal an HMOs decision to deny coverage, even if the HMO doctor agrees with the patient. The Bill of Rights would establish some form of expert appeal board external to the HMO. 
  * **_Medical Necessity: **_At issue is whether the doctor or the HMO management determines what is necessary. Determination of necessity may become subject to expert review as well, or it may become measured against established standards of generally accepted practices. 
  * **_Legal Liability: **_ Patients would be granted the right to sue HMOs for medical costs and damages, which is not a right under current law. Generally, liberals supoprt the right to sue HMOs while conservatives do not. This is the primary distinction between Republican and Democrat versions of Patient Bill of Rights proposals. 
  * **_Scope of Coverage: **_ Some states regulate HMOs in ways similar to those described here; a Bill of Rights could apply to them, to all HMOs, or to all patients. 
  * **_Prevention: **_ Advocating prevention implies support for removing government from health care, or opposition to more federal health care funding or national insurance. 
  * **_Consumer Choice: **_ Advocating consumer choice or reduction in healthcare bureaucracy implies support for removing government from health care, or opposition to national insurance. 
**MEDICAID / MEDICARE**

  * Medicare and Medicaid background is covered in the [Social Security](../Background_Social_Security.htm) section (but quotations are cross-referenced here). 
**EUTHANASIA**

  * The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in June 1997 that there is no constitutional right to euthanasia, but that states can allow euthanasia without federal intervention. 
  * Euthanasia means good death in the context of terminal illness. Buzzwords: 
  * **_Passive Euthanasia**:_ Hastening death by withdrawing life support. 
  * **_Active Euthanasia**:_ Causing death in response to a request from that person. The best-known examples are by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who was found guilty of 2nd degree murder in March 1999. 
  * **_Physician Assisted Suicide**:_ A physician supplies information and/or the means of committing suicide so that a patient can easily terminate their own life. 
  * **_Involuntary Euthanasia**:_ A synonym for murder; used by anti-euthanasia activists. 
  * **_Right to Die**:_ Establishing suicide as a civil right; used by pro-euthanasia activists. 
  * The state of Oregon passed a **_Death With Dignity**_ law, which was active until the federal Department of Justice reversed its enforcement policy in November 2001. 
**TOBACCO SETTLEMENT**

  * In Nov. 1998, 46 states settled the cases they had filed against the tobacco companies. (The other 4 states had previously settled, on similar terms) 
  * Now, the state legislatures are debating the best use of the settlement funds, which totals $246 billion to be paid over the next 25 years ($5 to $9 billion per year starting in April, 2000).
