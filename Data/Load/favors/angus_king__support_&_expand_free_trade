Angus Stanley King, Jr. (born March 31, 1944) is an American politician and the junior United States Senator from the state of Maine. As a former Democrat and political independent, he served as the 72nd Governor of Maine from 1995 to 2003, winning his first election in a 3-way race with 35.37% of the vote.
King won Maine's 2012 Senate election to replace the retiring Republican Olympia Snowe and took office on January 3, 2013. For committee assignment purposes, he caucuses with the Democratic Party.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
King was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the son of Ellen Archer (née Ticer) and Angus Stanley King, Sr., a lawyer. He has spent most of his adult years in the state of Maine. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1966 and the University of Virginia School of Law in 1969. While a student at Dartmouth, King joined the Delta Upsilon social fraternity.
Soon after graduation from Virginia, King entered private law practice in Brunswick, Maine. He was a staff attorney for Pine Tree Legal Assistance in Skowhegan. In 1972, he served as chief counsel to U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Narcotics. King served as a legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator William Hathaway in the 1970s. He was also well-known statewide as a television host on public television. In 1973, when he was 29, King was diagnosed with an aggressive form of malignant melanoma during a routine doctor's appointment—an appointment, King says, he never would have made had he not had health insurance at the time. As a result of the visit and the early detection, King was able to receive treatment, and the experience undergirds his support for the Affordable Care Act.
In 1975, King returned to Maine to practice with Smith, Loyd and King in Brunswick. In 1983, he was appointed vice president of Swift River/Hafslund Company, which developed alternative energy (hydro and biomass) projects in New England. In 1989, King founded Northeast Energy Management, Inc. The company developed, installed, and operated large-scale electrical energy conservation projects at commercial and industrial facilities throughout south-central Maine.


== Governor of Maine ==


=== 1994 election ===

In May 1993, King announced he would run for governor of Maine as an independent, as incumbent Governor John McKernan, a Republican, was term-limited and could not seek another term. King abandoned his lifelong affiliation with the Maine Democratic Party. "The Democratic Party as an institution has become too much the party that is looking for something from government," King explained to the Bangor Daily News a few weeks after he announced he would be running.
The Republican nominee was Susan Collins, Commissioner of Professional and Financial Regulation under Governor John McKernan and a protégée of U.S. Senator William Cohen, and at the time was relatively unknown to the electorate. The Democratic nominee was former Governor and U.S. Representative Joseph E. Brennan. It was Brennan's fifth campaign for governor.
The general election was a highly competitive four-way race between King, Collins, Brennan, and Green Party nominee Jonathan Carter. King decided to invest early in television advertising during Maine's unusually early June primary, allowing him to emerge from the primary season on an equal footing with his rivals. King positioned himself as a businessman and a pragmatic environmentalist focused on job creation and education. The Washington Times described him as an idealist who "wants to slash regulations but preserve the environment; hold the line on taxes; impose work and education requirements on welfare recipients; experiment with public school choice and cut at least $60 million from the state budget." His opponents criticized him for flip-flopping. Collins argued King "presents different images, depending on who he is talking to. Angus has been a Democrat his whole life. In my opinion, he became an independent because he didn't think he could beat Joe Brennan in a primary. He's extremely smooth, articulate and bright, but he says different things to different groups."
King narrowly won the November 8 election with 35% of the vote to Brennan's 34%, a margin of just 7,878 votes. (Collins received 23% of the vote and Carter 6%.) King won eight counties, Collins five and Brennan three. King's election as an independent was not unprecedented in Maine politics, as independent James B. Longley had been elected twenty years earlier.


=== 1998 election ===

Governor King won reelection to a second term in 1998 with 59% of the vote. He defeated Republican Jim Longley Jr. (the son of the former governor) (19%) and Democrat Thomas Connolly (12%). King's 59% was the highest a candidate had received since Brennan's 1982 reelection with 62% of the vote. Brennan's 1982 victory was also the last time before 1998 that a gubernatorial candidate had won a majority of the vote, and King's 1998 reelection remains the last time in a Maine gubernatorial election that the winner got a majority.


=== Tenure ===
During his tenure, King was the only governor in the United States unaffiliated with any political party. He was also one of only two governors nationwide not affiliated with either of the two major parties, the other being Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who was elected in 1998 as a member of the Reform Party. The term of Connecticut's independent governor Lowell Weicker ended when King's began. In his book Independent Nation (2004), political analyst John Avlon describes all three governors as radical centrist thinkers.

While in office King launched the Maine Learning Technology Initiative (MLTI) to provide laptops for every public middle-school student in the state, the first initiative of its kind in the nation. It met with considerable resistance due to its cost but was enacted by the Maine Legislature. On September 5, 2002, the state began the program with a four-year $37.2-million contract with Apple Inc. to equip all seventh- and eighth-grade students and teachers in the state with laptops. "I think we're going to demonstrate the power of one-to-one computer access that's going to transform education", King said in a Wired magazine interview. "The economic future will belong to the technologically adept." While ushering in the program, King quipped, "We've still got fish but we're heavily into the chips", in reference to Maine's fishing industry and the new laptop initiative.
One of King's more controversial initiatives was a law requiring all school employees – including volunteers and contractors working in schools – to be fingerprinted by the Maine State Police, and to have background checks conducted on them. The program purported to protect children from abuse by potential predators working within the schools but met with strong resistance from teachers' unions, which considered it a breach of civil liberties. The law's supporters claimed the fingerprinting requirement would stop previous offenders from coming to Maine to work in the schools and that if Maine did not have this requirement it would send a message to previous offenders that they could work in Maine without fear of being identified as child abusers. The law's critics maintained that there was no evidence of a problem with child abuse by school employees and the fingerprinting represented a violation of constitutional guarantees (a claim not supported by Supreme Court rulings on the issue). Fifty-seven teachers from across the state resigned in protest of the bill. The Maine Legislature voted to exempt current school employees, but King vetoed that in April 1997. The cost of the requirement was initially to be paid for by the school employees themselves but the Legislature voted to have the state fund it.


== Post-gubernatorial career (2003–12) ==
The day after he left office in 2003, King, his wife, Mary Herman, and their two children – Ben, 14, and Molly, 10 – embarked on a road trip in a 40-foot motor home to see America. Over the next six months, the family traveled 15,000 miles and visited 33 states before returning home in June 2003.
From 2004, King was a lecturer at Bowdoin College teaching a course called "Leaders and Leadership"; in the fall of 2009 and 2010, he taught a similar course at Bates College. He joined one of Maine's premier law firms, Bernstein Shur, and a mergers and acquisitions advisory firm (Leaders LLC) in Portland, Maine. He also worked on issues of sustainable and renewable energy. In spring 2009, he endorsed the Maine Green Energy Project, a summer program for young people to learn to build and advocate for green energy in Maine.
King was also involved in a wind power utility company, Independence Wind, co-founded with Robert Gardiner. In August 2009, Independence Wind along with joint venture partner Wagner Forest Management won Maine DEP approval for construction of a proposed $120-million, 22-turbine, utility-scale wind power project along a prominent mountain ridge in Roxbury, Maine. To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, King sold his part of the company after entering the 2012 U.S. Senate election. Of the project, King has said, "People who say wind is only an intermittent resource are looking for a one-shot solution. And my experience is that there are rarely silver bullets, but there is often silver buckshot. Wind is an adjunct source of energy. Ten percent, 20% can be very significant..." He also helped launch the Vital Signs education website at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in 2009. Vital Signs builds upon the 1-to-1 laptop network King established as governor.


== United States Senate ==


=== Elections ===

On March 5, 2012, King announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Olympia Snowe. King said "hogwash" to allegations by some Republicans that he had cut a deal with Democrats to keep U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree out of the race.
King's Senate campaign came under scrutiny for posting a heavily edited newspaper profile of him to the campaign website.
On November 6, 2012, King won the Senate race with 53% of the vote, beating Democrat Cynthia Dill and Republican Charlie Summers. The following week, King announced that he would caucus with Senate Democrats, explaining not only that it made more sense to affiliate with the party that had a clear majority, but that he would have been largely excluded from the committee process had he not caucused with a party. King said he had not ruled out caucusing with the Republicans if they took control of the Senate in 2014, but when that happened, he remained in the Democratic caucus.


=== Tenure ===
The website That's My Congress places King ideologically in the "mushy middle" of the Senate, while the website On the Issues considers him a "left-liberal".
King supports reform of the Senate filibuster, noting that senators are no longer required to stand on the floor and speak during a filibuster. He also points out that the Constitution contains no 60-vote requirement to conduct business in the Senate. Accordingly, in 2013 King voted in favor of the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster for most presidential nominees.
King opposes attempts by the U.S. House to cut $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over ten years, fearing that it "would affect people in a serious way" and drive more people to soup kitchens and food banks. He supports the more modest Senate efforts to save $4 billion over the same period by closing loopholes.
King had stated that he would not have been willing to attend the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, due to threats against the Games. He further stated that he would not have wanted his family to attend either.
In 2014 King was chosen for the annual honor of reading George Washington's Farewell Address to the Senate.
King endorsed his colleague Susan Collins for reelection in the 2014 U.S. Senate election, calling her a "model Senator". At the same time, he endorsed Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire for reelection. King also endorsed Eliot Cutler for Governor in the 2014 election, as he had done in 2010, although on October 29, 2014, he switched his endorsement to Democratic nominee Mike Michaud. He also endorsed Democrat Emily Cain for the Maine's second congressional district election and Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee in his reelection campaign.
After Republicans gained the Senate majority in the November 4, 2014 election, King announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats. He cited his belief that it is good for a state to have a senator from each party, and that it is important to have a senator who caucuses with the same party as the President, saying, "In the end, who I caucus with is less important than who I work with." He further said, "It does not mean I have become a Democrat. It does not mean I have made a promise to anybody."
On June 22, 2015, King announced that he would undergo prostate cancer surgery on June 26, adding, "I'm looking forward to a full recovery and to continuing my service in the Senate". King had shown no symptoms but doctors had found the cancer in a routine medical exam, and after a biopsy was given, the diagnosis was confirmed. King also announced that this did not change his plans to run for reelection in 2018.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Armed Services
Subcommittee on Personnel
Subcommittee on Seapower
Subcommittee on Strategic Forces

Committee on the Budget
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
Subcommittee on Energy
Subcommittee on National Parks
Subcommittee on Water and Power

Committee on Rules and Administration
Select Committee on Intelligence


== Political positions ==
Angus King has described himself as "neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but an 'American.'" His Crowdpac score is -4.3 (10 is the most conservative, -10 the most liberal), based on a data aggregation of his campaign contributions, votes, and speeches. King votes with the majority of Democrats about 90% of the time. He has also received higher approval ratings from liberal interest groups than conservative ones. King has been rated 89% by the average liberal interest group; the average conservative interest group rates him 14.5%.


=== Economy ===
King has called for the continuation of a tariff on imported athletic footwear and rejects discussing the potential removal of the tariff in trade talks with Vietnam, citing the potential loss of jobs at New Balance's Skowhegan and Madison factories in Maine. New Balance is the only remaining domestic manufacturer of athletic footwear. Also while governor, King vetoed a bill that would have raised Maine's minimum wage by 25 cents per hour.


=== Oil ===
King is opposed to the Keystone XL pipeline, stating that the "project will facilitate the transport of some of the world's dirtiest and most climate-harming oil through our country" and has cast several votes against legislation authorizing its construction. King has said that he is "frustrated" with President Obama's delay in deciding whether to authorize construction, but that he opposes Congress legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project.


=== Syria ===
King has voted to arm Syrian rebels who are fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ISIL militants.


=== Iran deal ===
In September 2015 King voted against a resolution of disapproval of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran deal, after expressing support for the pact.


=== Environment ===
King opposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, believing the amount of oil is not worth the environmental risk of extracting it. He also believes that new developments in the energy field, such as fracking and the Keystone XL pipeline, should be subject to "all appropriate environmental safeguards to protect the American people and the American land."
King has expressed opposition to the creation of a Maine Woods National Park, believing that local control is the best way to conserve land, but in 2014 stated he was keeping an open mind about the idea. He has "serious reservations" about the designation of land in the Katahdin region as a National Monument.
King opposes efforts in Maine to ban the baiting and trapping of bears, including an effort to put the question to voters in 2014, calling such practices necessary to prevent interaction between bears and people, and stating the practices are based on science and the views of experts.


=== Veterans ===
King supports the Department of Veterans Affairs goal to eliminate both its claim backlog and veteran homelessness by 2015.


=== Education ===
King proposes supporting teacher development, by attempting to elevate the teaching profession to something attractive for top students. With over 29% of teachers claiming they are likely to leave the profession, King proposes steps such as creating a recruitment program, supporting research and development, and improving access to technology. He additionally proposes increasing parent involvement in the classroom, supporting measures like gas cards for parents.


=== Gun laws ===
King supports expanding background checks to most firearms transactions, with exceptions for transfers between family members, calling such a position "the single most effective step" that can be taken to keep guns out of the wrong hands. He supports limiting the size of magazines to 10 rounds, and to make purchasing a gun for someone not legally allowed to have one a federal crime. He does not support a ban on assault weapons, believing it will not work and that such a ban is not based on the functionality of the weapons, which are not relevantly different from the many hunting rifles owned by Maine residents. He further states that the vast majority of crimes are committed with handguns, not assault weapons.
King voted for the Manchin-Toomey amendment to expand background checks for gun purchases.


=== Health issues ===
King supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He is also pro-choice on abortion.
On September 27, 2013, King voted to restore funding for the Affordable Care Act as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days, which also omitted House-passed language prioritizing debt payments if Congress failed to increase the nation’s borrowing limits. He has said that those opposed to the ACA who are attempting to discourage people from purchasing health insurance are "guilty of murder" and that doing so was "one of the grossest violations of our humanity that I could think of." In making this comment, King noted a time in his life when he would have died had he not just acquired health insurance.


=== Same-sex marriage ===
King supports same-sex marriage, stating that it is "necessary to provide couples and their families with equal protection under the law." King also signed an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor encouraging it to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act.


== Awards and honors ==
The National Retail Federation gave King the 2014 "Hero of Main Street" award for his support of American retailers.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Support &amp; Expand Free Trade **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: Free trade is always in the people's interest. We should have open trade with every country in the world. The government has no right to make restrictions on imports or exports. NAFTA, GATT, and the WTO should be expanded and made less restrictive over time. Globalization is good. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Free trade is in our national interest because it provides economic growth and jobs. We should only restrict free trade when it poses a security risk. Including environmental and labor safeguards are acceptable if they can be successfully negotiated into trade agreements, but should not be used as a pretext to stop trade agreements. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Free Trade should be replaced by Fair Trade. Free trade is not in our national interest when it poses a risk to job security, causes humanitarian problems overseas, or results in environmental damage. Globalization should focus on benefiting people instead of benefiting multinational corporations. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Americans should buy from other Americans because that creates American jobs. We should restrict trade with any country which costs us jobs or which creates a trade deficit. Globalization is just another means of corporate influence over our society. 

This question is looking for your views on opening the US economy to the rest
of the world. However you answer the above question would be similar to your
response to these statements:

  * Support NAFTA and trade with Mexico
  * Support the WTO and GATT
  * Expand free trade agreements to more countries
  * A 'Global Economy' helps the US economy
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of open global trade. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** improvements to increase international trade over time. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe **practical** restrictions on trade based on labor, environment, human rights, and national security. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of "Buy American" and that international trade just ships jobs overseas. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**  

**International Trade Buzzwords**

* **_NAFTA**_: refers to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which in 1994 established a free-trade zone between the US, Canada, and Mexico. NAFTA passed with some important compromises to protect the environment and labor standards. In 2001, President Bush formalized the proposal of expanding NAFTA to a Free Trade Area for the Americas (FTAA), encompassing 34 countries and 800 million people by 2005. Pres. Obama continues to push for expansion to CAFTA (Central American Free Trade Agreement) 

* **_WTO**_: refers to the World Trade Organization, an international organization intended to reduce trade barriers, formed in 1995. WTO members (which include China since 2001) charge minimal import tariffs on each other. The WTO adjudicates international disputes over trade barriers, such as currency manipulation. 

* **_Currency Manipulation**_: The Republican primary contenders, especially Mitt Romney, accuse China of manipulating their currency. That means they maintain an artifically low exchange rate which makes Chinese goods relatively inexpensive for export. The result is that the US imports more goods from China, at lower cost for US consumers, but the manufacturing jobs are in China. 

* **_Fast-Track**_: means authorizing the President to sign trade deals with a single yes-or-no Congressional vote after only limited debate. Supporting Fast-Track implies the speaker supports free trade. 

* **_Fair Trade**_: means placing restrictions on imports based on environmental, labor, or other concerns. Supporting Fair Trade implies the speaker is against free trade. 

* **_Trade Deficits**_: mean that the US imports more than we export to a particular country. Concern over trade deficits implies supporting trade restrictions against Mexico, Japan, and East Asia, with whom the US has large trade deficits. 

**NAFTA**
* The North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994 establishes a free-trade zone between the US, Canada, and Mexico. 
* A free trade zone means that goods can cross the border in either direction without tariffs or taxes of any kind. 
* Canada is the largest trading partner of the US, accounting for over 25% of both our imports and exports. 
* Mexico & Japan account for about 15% each; Europe combined for about 20%; and East Asia combined for about 15%. 
* NAFTA passed with some important compromises to protect the environment and labor standards; these are refered to as Side Agreements. 
* In 1994, President Clinton invited Chile to join NAFTA as the next step toward a Free Trade Zone for the Americas. 
* In 2001, President Bush formalized the proposal of expanding NAFTA to a Free Trade Area for the Americas, encompassing 34 countries and 800 million people by 2005. 

**GATT & WTO**
* The World Trade Organization is an international organization intended to reduce trade barriers, formed in 1995. 
* The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs is the international treaty which preceded the WTO's formation; it began in 1947. 
* The Uruguay Round was the most recently completed round of GATT negotiations, completed in 1994. 
* Negotiations to start a new Round took place in Seattle in Dec. 1999, but were disrupted by riots. 
* WTO members (which includes the US and most industrialized countries) grant each other MFN or Most Favored Nation status, which means minimal import tariffs. 

**Globalization**
* Globalization refers generally to free trade, open borders, improved communication and transportation, and the commerce implications of the Internet. 
* Specifically, anti-globalization advocates refer to the negative aspects of free trade on environmental and labor standards. At issue is that open borders cause corporations to seek out the lowest environmental and labor standards to minimize production costs, thereby pressuring for lower standards globally. 
* Anti-globalization advocates primarily focus on the secrecy of WTO proceedings, but also criticize other international trade organizations as too favorable to corporate interests. 
* Anti-globalization protests have been particularly effective since a large protest at a WTO meeting in Seattle in late 1999. The 2001 WTO meeting was held in Qatar (in the Persian Gulf) partially to make protest more difficult b its remoteness. 
* While the anti-corporate aspect of anti-globalization is primarily a liberal cause, many conservatives join the anti-globalization movement on grounds of protection of national sovereignty. At issue is that the WTO and international trade agreements override national law, and hence place the US Congress and the US President subordinate to an unelected foreign organization. **Anti-Dumping Laws**
* Dumping: A country sells goods in the US at costs lower than they are sold in the home country, presumably with the intent of capturing market share. 
* Countervailing Duties: The US imposes import tariffs -- often 100% or more -- on goods which the government determines have been dumped. 
* In the last 4 years, the federal government found dumping in 107 cases, mostly steel from Asia but also on European bananas, and imposed countervailing duties.
