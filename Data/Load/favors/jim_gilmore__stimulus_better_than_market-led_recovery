James Stuart "Jim" Gilmore III (born October 6, 1949) is an American politician who was the 68th Governor of Virginia from 1998 to 2002. A native Virginian, Gilmore graduated as a Bachelor of Arts and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia, and then served in the U.S. Army as a counterintelligence agent. He was later elected to public office as a county prosecutor, as the Attorney General of Virginia, and as Governor of Virginia. On July 30, 2015, Gilmore announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States, in the 2016 election. On February 12, 2016, he suspended his campaign.


== Early life and education ==
Gilmore was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Margaret Evelyn (n√©e Kandle), a church secretary, and James Stuart Gilmore, Jr., a grocery store meat cutter. He graduated from John Randolph Tucker High School and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia in 1971.


== Military service ==
Gilmore enlisted in the United States Army after attending college, receiving training and preparation for service in the Military Intelligence Corps at the newly created United States Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca in Arizona. Gilmore also received rigorous foreign language education at the United States Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California. Gilmore then worked for three years in the early 1970s, in the 650th Military Intelligence Group. Serving in West Germany during the Vietnam War and fluent in German, he served as a U.S. Army Counterintelligence Agent.


== Legal career ==
Gilmore graduated from University of Virginia Law School in 1977. Gilmore was elected Commonwealth's Attorney in Henrico County in 1987 and 1991, and then was elected attorney general in 1993. Gilmore resigned in 1997 to run for governor.


== Governor of Virginia ==
In 1997, Gilmore faced then-Lieutenant Governor Don Beyer and Reform Party candidate Sue Harris Debauche in a bid to succeed George Allen as governor. Gilmore campaigned heavily on the twin promises of hiring 4,000 new teachers in public schools and phasing out Virginia's personal property tax on automobiles. Gilmore was elected, winning 56% of the vote to Beyer's 43%.
In his first year as governor, Gilmore pushed for car tax reduction legislation that was eventually passed by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly. The legislation reduced car taxes on all cars valued less than $1,000, and phased out the tax on auto values over $1,000 as follows: 12.5% reduction in 1998; 25% reduction in 1999; 47.5% reduction in 2000; 70% reduction in 2001; 100% reduction in 2002. Beginning in 2001, Virginia's economy slowed and tax revenues flattened. In addition to a downturn in the national economy in 2001, Northern Virginia's economy was severely impacted after terrorists flew a hijacked airplane into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on September 11, 2001, resulting in the closure of Reagan National Airport for several months. Despite the economic downturn, Gilmore insisted on advancing the car tax phase out from a 47.5% reduction of each taxpayer's bill in 2000 to the scheduled 70% reduction in 2001. Gilmore signed an executive order, which was passed by Congress, reducing state spending by all agencies, except for education, to keep the state's budget balanced during the economic downturn. Democrats criticized the spending reductions and car tax cut. According to the Washington Post, "Virginia's politicians struggled to balance car-tax relief against demands for public services." When Gilmore left office in January 2002, the state's "rainy day fund," or revenue stabilization fund, had fallen to $900 million.
Gilmore also implemented new Standards of Learning reforms in Virginia's public schools. The Standards of Learning prescribed a uniform curriculum in mathematics, science, English and social studies and instituted new tests at the end of the third, fifth and eighth grades, as well as end-of-course tests in high school, to measure student achievement. During Gilmore's term, Virginia's public school students' scores increased on these state tests as well as nationally normed tests.
In 1999, Gilmore proposed and signed into law legislation that reduced tuitions at public colleges and universities by 20%. Gilmore also commissioned a Blue Ribbon Commission on Higher Education that studied accountability and governance of public colleges and universities. Gilmore's Commission authored the first blueprint for decentralized regulatory and administrative authority to some universities in return for agreements to meet agreed upon performance objectives.
Gilmore also proposed and signed into law Virginia's first stand-alone Martin Luther King Holiday. Prior to this proposal, Virginia had observed a combined Lee-Jackson-King Day that recognized Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Martin Luther King on the same day each year. Gilmore and his wife hosted a historic reception in the Governor's Mansion for Coretta Scott King and announced a technology partnership between Virginia and the King Center for Nonviolence. Gilmore also proposed and funded a new African-American History Trail in Virginia and called upon the State Board of Education to include a more diverse range of historical figures in Virginia's Social Studies curriculum. Test scores during Gilmore's term showed a narrowing of the "achievement gap" between minority and white students. Gilmore significantly increased funding for two of Virginia's historically black universities, Norfolk State University and Virginia State University.
Gilmore created the nation's first state Secretary of Technology, a position first held by Donald Upson. Together they established a statewide technology commission, and signed into law the nation's first comprehensive state Internet policy.
During his term, 37 people were executed in Virginia. Gilmore granted executive clemency to one death row inmate on the basis of mental illness. In another well publicized case, he pardoned Earl Washington, a former death row inmate, after DNA tests, ordered by Gilmore, implicated another person. Gilmore also ordered DNA tests in the case of Derek Rocco Barnabei; the tests confirmed Barnabei's guilt and he was executed.
As governor, Gilmore signed into law legislation establishing a 24-hour waiting period and informed consent for women seeking an abortion, as well as a ban against partial birth abortion. Gilmore increased funding for adoption services. He also signed into law a bill that banned human cloning. In 1998, Gilmore went to court to try to prevent the removal of a feeding tube of coma victim Hugh Finn. Gilmore argued that removal of a feeding tube was not removal of artificial life support because it amounted to starvation of an infirm person who could not feed himself. As Attorney General of Virginia, Gilmore had defended a legal challenge to Virginia's first parental notification law for minors seeking abortions.
The Virginia Constitution forbids any governor from serving consecutive terms, so Gilmore could not run for a second term in 2001. He was succeeded by Democrat Mark Warner, who took office in early 2002.


== Subsequent positions ==

During his term as governor, Gilmore chaired the Congressional Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. The Commission was charged with the task of making recommendations to the United States Congress on Internet taxation. The Commission's Report to Congress opposed taxation of the Internet.
From 1999 to 2003, Gilmore chaired the Congressional Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, nicknamed the Gilmore Commission. It presented five reports to Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and to Congress each December 15 from 1999 through 2003.
From January 2001 to January 2002, Gilmore was the Chairman of the Republican National Committee.


== 2008 presidential candidacy ==

A "Draft Gilmore for President" group was formed in August 2006 encouraging Gilmore to run for President of the United States. On December 19, 2006, Gilmore announced he would form an exploratory committee to "fill the conservative void" in the race. On January 9, 2007, Gilmore officially filed papers with the Federal Election Commission to form the Jim Gilmore for President Exploratory Committee.
Gilmore said he represented "the Republican wing of the Republican Party" in the race for the 2008 Presidential nomination; the comment mirrored the slogan used by Howard Dean when seeking the Democratic nomination in the 2004 election, who lifted the slogan from Senator Paul Wellstone. Gilmore officially announced his candidacy on April 26, 2007.
In the first quarter of 2007 Gilmore raised $174,790, the second lowest of any of the major-party candidates. Gilmore hosted only one fundraiser in the first quarter due to a late exploratory announcement.
On July 14, 2007, Gilmore announced that he was ending his campaign. Gilmore said that it would be "impractical" to run, citing the difficulty of raising enough money to be competitive in early-voting states Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.


== 2008 Senate campaign ==

In an interview with Politico, Gilmore said that he had been approached to run for the Senate seat of John Warner, who announced his retirement for his senate term ending in 2009. By the end of the summer, many media outlets, most notably the Washington Post, thought it would be a foregone conclusion that Gilmore would jump into the Senate race. Gilmore's successor as governor, Mark Warner, had already announced in September, and 11th District Congressman Tom Davis had informally announced his candidacy a few days after Mark Warner's announcement.
Gilmore lobbied strongly for choosing the party's nominee at a statewide convention rather than a primary, claiming that a convention would cost only $1 million versus the $4 million required to run a primary campaign. This was no small consideration, as the race for the Democratic nomination essentially ended with Mark Warner's entry into the race. It was understood that Warner would use his considerable wealth to self-finance his campaign. It was thought that a convention would favor Gilmore, since most of the delegates would come from the party's activist base, which is tilted strongly to the right. A primary was thought to favor Davis due to his popularity in voter-rich Northern Virginia; Davis is a moderate Republican, and most Republicans in Northern Virginia tend to be more moderate than their counterparts elsewhere in the state. On October 13, 2007 the state party's central committee voted 47‚Äì37 to hold a convention rather than a primary. With this decision, Gilmore said he was seriously considering a run for the Senate.
Gilmore formally announced his candidacy via a YouTube video on November 19, 2007. He said that he was running to give Virginia "a strong and steady hand" in the Senate. The domain name jimgilmoreforsenate.com had been registered on July 10 ‚Äì four months before Gilmore's formal entry ‚Äì and the username that uploaded the video to YouTube had been registered on October 16.
Gilmore faced a challenge from his right in State Delegate Bob Marshall of Prince William County. Marshall charged Gilmore with being too soft on abortion. However, at the convention Gilmore won the nomination by only 65 votes out of 3,000 cast.
In the November election, Gilmore was defeated, winning only 34 percent of the vote to Warner's 65 percent. Gilmore only carried four counties in the state ‚Äì Rockingham, Augusta, Powhatan and Hanover. In many cases, he lost in many areas of the state that are normally reliably Republican.


== 2016 presidential candidacy ==

On July 7, 2015, Gilmore told the Associated Press that he planned to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination in the first week of August 2015. On July 29, Gilmore filed his candidacy for President of the United States with the Federal Election Commission. He announced his candidacy via an internet video clip the next day.
According to his campaign website, Gilmore's main issues that he would address if elected President include preserving the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, immigration and border re-enforcement, healthcare reform, and restoring America's economy. Gilmore struggled to gain any traction in the 2016 presidential race, and has been little known among voters, being excluded from most of the debates.
In the 2016 Iowa Republican caucuses, Gilmore received 12 votes, not earning him any delegates. He then received 133 votes in the New Hampshire primary. On February 12, Gilmore suspended his campaign.


== Personal life ==
Gilmore is the President & CEO of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank which was founded by Paul Weyrich.
Gilmore has also served as Chairman of the National Council on Readiness & Preparedness, a homeland security program focused on community involvement and public/private partnerships. He is also President of USA Secure, a non-profit homeland security think tank based in Washington, D.C.
He is also on the Board of Directors of the National Rifle Association.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Stimulus better than market-led recovery **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe: The federal government should inject as much funding as needed to recuperate from the Great Recession, including direct federal job creation. Nationalization of banks and companies is more appropriate than bailouts. 
  * **Support** means you believe: The federal government should institute incentives for private corporations for more hiring, to recuperate from the Great Recession. Funding to "bail out" private companies should be accompanied by rules for corporate behavior and repayment. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Cutting taxes and reducing regulation is the means to recuperate from the Great Recession. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: The federal government caused the Great Recession, and keeping out of the economy will end it. 

This question is looking for your views on the government's role in moving the
country out of the Great Recession.   However you answer the above question
would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Corporate malfeasance caused the [Great Recession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession). 
  * More regulation is the solution to the Great Recession, not the cause of it. 
  * A company that is [too big to fail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail) should be nationalized, or run by the federal government. 
  * Corporate bailouts made some sense, to save jobs, but bank bailouts just rewarded the wrongdoers. 
  * Wall Street bankers of the early 2000s are no different than the [robber barons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_\(industrialist\)) of the early 1900s. 
  * [Occupy Wall Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street) expresses the voice of the people agaisnt the voice of Big Business. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of federal intervention in the economy. 
  * **Support** means you believe government oversight is needed for **practical** reasons: the Great Recession is a big enough cause, but most others aren't. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe in **practical** reasons for lower taxation and deregulation, to quickly increase hiring. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of lower taxation and deregulation, regardless of the current situation.

(Pres. Obama's latest budget)

The federal budget is not difficult to understand. Politicians intentionally
muddy the water and thereby make the federal budget difficult to understand,
to gain political advantage for one political goal or another. We will explain
the basics here -- everything else is politics.

  * _**Spending and revenue:**_ The budget has two important halves: spending (where the money goes) and revenue (where the money comes from). The two sides have to equal each other, in order to account for all the money. 

### Where the money goes

  * _**National Debt:**_ The annual budget deficits don't get paid off each year -- they just accumulate year after year, into the National Debt, which is currently over $13 trillion. We pay interest in that debt -- amounting to $901 billion in 2012. 
  * _**Entitlements:**_ The largest budget spending items, totalling $1.6 trillion in 2012, are Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid -- the so-called entitlement programs. The policy options for these programs are discussed in the [Social Security](Social_Security.htm) section. 
  * _**Non-discretionary spending:**_ The federal budget separates mandatory payments from discretionary spending. Entitlements and interest (plus another $583 billion in smaller programs) are deemed non-discretionary while everything else is deemed discretionary. Those terms are political double-talk -- Congress has the discretion to make political decisions on funding mandatory programs just like every other political decision. But because so many people rely on these funds, it is politically difficult to alter them in the short-term, so most discussion applies to the very long-term (with small changes in current policy that have large effect years later). 
  * _**National Defense spending:**_ Funding the Pentagon is by far the largest discretionary item in the budget. The policy options for defense programs are discussed in the [Homeland Security](Homeland_Security.htm) section. 
  * _**Supplemental spending:**_ Congress and the Bush Administration routinely pretended that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan posed unexpected expenses. Therefore they were not funded in the regular budget, but instead by a special Supplemental Spending Bill which is voted on separately, outside of the budget, each year. Pres. Obama in 2010 changed to using an on-budget Overseas Contingency Operations instead of off-budget war supplemental bills. 
  * _**Discretionary spending:**_ All other non-defense expenditures total up to 14% of the budget. This budget section is where most Congressional debate focuses, even though the other budget sections are far larger. Republicans endlessly lambast NEA spending ($0.1 billion for the National Endowment for the Arts in 2008) and Democrats equally lambast spending on the Special Prosecutor (about $0.06 billion to produce the report that led to Bill Clinton's impeachment). 
  * If Republicans want to reduce the size of government, or if Democrats want fiscal responsibility, they should focus on the Big Four listed above: defense spending; Social Security; Medicare/Medicaid; and the budget deficit. Everything else is political -- they have a very minor impact on the budget totals. On the other hand, we should keep in mind the enormous scale of the budget: as one analyst said, A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon youre talking real money. 
  * Politicians often call for "freezing all but the non-defense non-entitlement budget" -- a typical politicians' attempt to muddy the water -- defense and entitlements account for the majority of the budget. 
  * Furthermore, Congress has full control over "mandatory" spending (it's only mandated from the previous year; Congress can change it at any time). 
  * Voters should listen for other (very common!) attempts at muddying the water, by looking at what are the actual underlying amounts being discussed. 

### Where the money comes from

  * _**Individual income taxes:**_ The biggest component of federal revenue is the income tax -- and this is what politicians mostly talk about when discussing policy. The $1.3 trillion in personal income taxes does not include state income taxes, sales tax, or any other local tax. Tax policy is detailed in our [Tax Reform](Tax_Reform.htm) section. 
  * _**Social insurance (FICA):**_ This comes up in the 2012 debates as raising the cap. In theory, each person's individual FICA funds their own retirement, so the tax is "capped" at income of $106,800 in 2012, up from $92,500 in 2008. Income above $106,800 has no FICA tax. In practice, the sum of FICA payments all go into the Social Security Trust Fund, so some politicians say the individual link is meaningless, and therefore FICA is a regressive tax (the wealthy pay less). Raising the cap, or removing it entirely, would raise revenue substantially. Details are discussed in the [Social Security](Social_Security.htm) section. 
  * _**Corporate income taxes:**_ US corporate income taxes are the second-highest in the world, tax-cutter politicians constantly remind us. The sum is still only 1/6th of what individuals pay. Details of all corporate tax policy are discussed in the [Corporations](Corporations.htm) section. 
  * _**Other taxes & duties:**_ While only 6% of federal revenue comes from everything other than those three sources, this smallest section once again includes a lot of the political debate. The "Death Tax" (inheritance tax) is included here; and Mitt Romney was damaged by claiming that raising user fees in this category should not count as tax increases. 
  * _**Budget deficit:**_ Unlike normal budgets, the federal government can print its own money. The deficit amounted to $901 billion in 2012. The form of printing money to cover the deficit varies from year to year; the recent favorite is federal bonds that are sold to foreign governments and other wealthy entities. That leads to political accusations that, for example, the Chinese government is funding our deficit. 

### Budget Buzzwords

  * _**QE3**_ refers to Quantitative Easing of the money supply by the Federal Reserve, the third round of which took place in Sept. 2012. The QE3 program entails purchasing $40 billion monthly in mortgage-backed securities. QE1 and QE2, earlier in the Great Recession, injected $2.3 trillion into the economy, also via the securities market. Critics call the programs printing money which is inherently inflationary. 
  * The _**sequester**_ refers to automatic budget cuts mandated after the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011. The Super committee" failed to come up with a budget replacement plan in late 2011, so the sequestration rules take effect in 2013. Those rules specify across-the-board spending cuts of $1.2 trillion in the period 2013 to 2021. The cuts apply to Medicare and DoD roughly equally; i.e., social spending and defense spending are both cut for political balance. 
  * The _**debt ceiling**_: The 2013 budget includes a deficit of $901 billion (more spending than revenue). The annual budget deficits dont get paid off each yearthey just accumulate year after year, into the National Debt, which is currently over $15 trillion. We pay interest on that debtamounting to $246 billion in 2012. Congress determines the debt ceiling, which is the total amount that the federal government can be in debt. The actual debt must remain lower than the debt ceiling or the government may not borrow more money; currently the ceiling is set at $16.4 trillion. 
  * _**Dodd-Frank**_ refers to Sen. Chris Dodd (D, CT) and Rep. Barney Frank (D, MA), the co-authors of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation was intended to reform the rules of the financial and insurance industry to avoid another "meltdown" like the one in mid-2008 which initiated the Great Recession. 
  * _**Earmarks**_ refers to itemized spending in legislation, i.e., funding targeted toward a particular project in a particular place. The controversy comes about because often the particular place includes the home district of the legislator writing or sponsoring the bill (which is known derisively as "Pork-Barrel Spending"). Earmarks are currently legal and are generally considered ethical; earmark reform focuses on publicizing their existence and perhaps on a future Line Item Veto to remove some. 
  * _**Fannie & Freddie**_ refer to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, Freddie Mac). Fannie and Freddie were "GSEs"--government-sponsored enterprises--half-private, half-federal, until 2008, when they were placed under full federal control. Their role is to assist banks with creating individual mortgages. 
  * _**PAYGO**_ refers to a "pay-as-you-go" policy, where all expenditures in a bill are explicitly paid for, instead of requiring borrowing. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 required all new spending bills to include how the spending would be balanced by revenue enhancements (taxes or fees) or other spending cuts. The PAYGO statute expired in 2002, but some congressional bills still describe offsets for new spending. 
  * _**Simpson-Bowles**_ refers to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and its conclusions released in 2010. It is named after its two chairs, Sen. Alan Simpson (R, WY) and Erskine Bowles (D, NC). The Commission proposed reducing the national debt by a combination of increased revenue (raising taxes, including a 15-cent gas tax); reductions in discretionary spending; Medicare cost controls; raising the Social Security retirement age; and a reduction in entitlements.

### Budget Deficit versus National Debt

A budget deficit means that the amount the government receives in taxes in one
fiscal year is less than the amount that the government has spent. Generally,
the government borrows money from people by issuing bonds to cover the
deficit.

The accumulated borrowing is the National Debt that the government must repay
in the future. The current federal debt stands at over $13 trillion, which is
the equivalent of roughly $40,000 per person. The federal government pays over
$200 billion in annual interest on the national debt.

### Social Security Trust Fund

  * Much debate focuses on how the budget deficit is calculated and how the Social Security Trust Fund is accounted for. 
  * The Trust Fund is off-budget, which means it is not counted in the reporting of the budget. 
  * However, the government reports the budget surplus or deficit from a Unified Budget which _does_ include the Trust Fund. Hence the growth of the Fund offsets the shortfall in the budget. 
  * In 1998, the budget surplus was reported as $40 billion on the unified budget. Discounting the Trust Fund, the budget would have been in deficit by $50 billion. 
  * By 2008, th e budget deficit has returned in full force -- to $246 billion, and after 2008, increased substantially more for stimulus spending to deal with the Great Recession. 

### The Federal Reserve

Ben Bernanke is the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, which is known as
The Fed. (Alan Greenspan was the previous chairman) . The Federal Reserve
chairman is appointed to a 4-year term by the President but then cannot be
removed, to allow The Fed independence in monetary policy.

Bernankes primary responsibility is to set the interest rates that the
government pays on its bonds. Those rates in turn determine bank interest
rates, mortgage lending rates, and other interest rates.

When the Federal Reserve Bank feels that there is to much inflationary
pressure, they are likely to raise interest rates to slow the economy down.
Hence, Bernanke raises interest rates (tightens money) when he sees the
economy as overheating, and lowers interest rates (loosens money) when he sees
deflation threatening.

The longest economic expansion in US history ended in October 2001. During
2001, Alan Greenspan lowered interest an unprecedented 10 times in one year,
to provide monetary stimulus to the lagging economy. President Bush pushed for
fiscal stimulus by sending out $300 tax rebate checks to millions of
taxpayers.

In 2007-2008, to attempt to counter the mortgage crisis leading to a
recession, Ben Bernanke tried the same strategy, lowering interest rates
repeatedly.

### Mortgage Crisis

The Subprime mortgage crisis began with a sharp rise in home foreclosures in
the United States during the fall of 2006 and became a global financial crisis
during 2007 and 2008. The crisis began with the bursting of the housing bubble
in the U.S. and high default rates on "subprime", adjustable rate, and other
mortgage loans made to higher-risk borrowers with lower income or lesser
credit history than "prime" borrowers.

  * The mortgage crisis may lead to a recession because of the large number of people affected, and because the construction sector is a large factor in the economy. Hence politicians are all proposing "stimulus packages" to stave off a recession. Those proposals -- and reactions to Pres. Bush's version of a one-time tax rebate and later economic stimulus measures -- make up the majority of presidential candidates' comments in this topic area. 
  * **Economic Stimulus Act**: In Feb. 2008, Pres. Bush pushed legislation intended to avoid a full financial crisis, by mailing tax rebate checks of several hundred dollars to every taxpayer. The checks arrived at a time when fuel prices reached an all-time high, breaking $4 per gallon of gasoline in the summer of 2008. Discussion of additional economic stimulus (and whether the initial stimulus succeeded) was lost in the more urgent financial crises later in 2008. 
  * **Housing and Economic Recovery Act**: In late July 2008, Congress enacted legislation intended to avoid a full financial crisis, by injecting $300 billion into the mortgage market to restructure subprime mortgage loans. As a result, on Sept. 7, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental mortgage entities, were placed under federal control. 
  * **Fannie and Freddie**: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are "GSEs" -- government-sponsored enterprises -- semi-public corporations designed to assist banks with creating individual mortgages. The names are acronyms for Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, Freddie Mac). "Semi-public" means half-private, half-federal, until 2008, when they were placed under full federal control. Their role is to assist banks with creating individual mortgages. 
  * **Emergency Economic Stabilization Act**: In Oct. 2008, Congress enacted a $700 billion package intended to alleviate severely contracted liquidity in the global credit market (which means banks would not lend each other funds, and hence no credit would be available to consumers for mortgages or credit cards); and to address insolvency threats to investment banks (which means, big banks would go broke, potentially causing a run on other banks as consumers lost confidence).   
  
\- This legislation is commonly referred to as the "financial bailout" in
political discussions, even though the funding is structured as investments
that may yield positive returns (which means, the net cost to taxpayers could
conceivably be much lower than $700 billion, over several years).  
  
\- The essence of the financial bailout is that the Secretary of the Treasury
is empowered to purchase "troubled assets" in the banking and insurance
industry. with the intent of stabilizing and then re-selling those assets when
the crisis is past.  
  
\- The final legislation went through several major revisions in Congress,
including two well-publicized NO votes in the US House, followed by public
speeches from Pres. Bush that changes would follow. Sen. McCain suspended his
presidential campaign to deal with one version of the bailout vote.  
  
\- The popular $700 billion figure is also inaccurate; the final legislation
totalled $850 billion, adding $150 billion in unrelated projects to garner
positive votes from holdout members of Congress.  
  
\- The taxpayer cost of the bailout, if it totals a net cost of $700 billion,
would be $4,635 per working American (based on an estimate of 151 million in
the work force).  
  
\- Rhetoric abounds on both sides of the financial bailout: proponents insist
it was necessary to avoid a full-blown Depression; opponents insist it is a
federal takeover of the banking industry destined to cause hyperinflation.

### Great Recession

  * **Dodd-Frank**: refers to Sen. Chris Dodd (D, CT) and Rep. Barney Frank (D, MA), the co-authors of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation was intended to reform the rules of the financial and insurance industry to avoid another "meltdown" like the one in mid-2008 which initiated the Great Recession. 
  * **Earmarks**: refers to itemized spending in legislation, i.e., funding targeted toward a particular project in a particular place. The controversy comes about because often the particular place includes the home district of the legislator writing or sponsoring the bill (which is known derisively as "Pork-Barrel Spending"). Earmarks are currently legal and are generally considered ethical; earmark reform focuses on publicizing their existence and perhaps on a future Line Item Veto to remove some. 
  * **PAYGO**: refers to a "pay-as-you-go" policy, where all expenditures in a bill are explicitly paid for, instead of requiring borrowing. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 required all new spending bills to include how the spending would be balanced by revenue enhancements (taxes or fees) or other spending cuts. The PAYGO statute expired in 2002, but some congressional bills still describe offsets for new spending. 
  * **Simpson-Bowles**: refers to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and its conclusions released in 2010. It is named after its two chairs, Sen. Alan Simpson (R, WY) and Erskine Bowles (D, NC). The Commission proposed reducing the national debt by a combination of increased revenue (raising taxes, including a 15-cent gas tax); reductions in discretionary spending; Medicare cost controls; raising the Social Security retirement age; and a reduction in entitlements.
