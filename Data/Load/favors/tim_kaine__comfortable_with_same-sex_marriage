Timothy Michael "Tim" Kaine (born February 26, 1958) is an American politician serving as the junior United States Senator from Virginia. A member of the Democratic Party, Kaine was elected to the Senate in 2012.
Born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Kaine is a graduate of Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kaine began his career as a clerk for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit before entering private practice and becoming a lecturer at the University of Richmond School of Law. Kaine was first elected to public office in 1995, when he won a seat on the Richmond, Virginia City Council. He was then elected Mayor of Richmond in 1998, serving in that position until being elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 2002.
As all Virginia governors are limited to one consecutive term, Kaine declared his candidacy for Governor of Virginia in 2005, in a bid to replace Mark Warner. Kaine won in an uncontested Democratic primary, and faced Republican Attorney General Jerry Kilgore in the general election; Kaine won with 51% of the vote, to Kilgore's 46%. Kaine served as governor from 2006 to 2010. Upon becoming governor, Kaine gave the Democratic response to the 2006 State of the Union Address. He was considered a top contender for running mate in Senator Barack Obama's successful 2008 presidential campaign, but instead became the 51st Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, serving from 2009 to 2011.
In 2012, after incumbent Senator Jim Webb announced that he would retire, Kaine declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. Kaine prevailed in the Democratic primary and faced former Senator and Virginia Governor George Allen in the general election. On November 6, 2012, Kaine won with 53% of the vote, to Allen's 47%. Kaine was sworn into office on January 3, 2013.


== Early life and education ==
Kaine was born at Saint Joseph's Hospital in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He is the son of Mary Kathleen (née Burns) and Albert Alexander Kaine, Jr., who worked as a welder and owned a small iron-working shop. He was raised Catholic. His father is of Scottish and Irish descent, and his mother is of Irish ancestry. Kaine grew up in the Kansas City area and graduated from Rockhurst High School in Kansas City, Missouri.
Kaine graduated from the University of Missouri with a B.A. in economics in 1979. Kaine was a Coro Foundation fellow in Kansas City in 1978. He attended Harvard Law School, taking a year-long break during law school to work with the Jesuit order as a Catholic missionary in Honduras. Kaine is fluent in Spanish as a result of his year in Honduras. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1983 with a Juris Doctor, and was admitted to the Virginia Bar. He clerked for Judge R. Lanier Anderson III of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In 1984, Kaine married former Richmond Juvenile Court Judge Anne Holton. Holton is the daughter of former Virginia governor A. Linwood Holton, Jr. Kaine and Holton have three children, Nat, Woody, and Annella.
Kaine practiced law in Richmond for 17 years, specializing in representing people who had been denied housing opportunities because of their race or disability. He was recognized by local, state, and national organizations for his advocacy of fair housing. He also taught legal ethics for six years at the University of Richmond Law School. More than ten years into his legal career in 1994, he was elected to the city council of the independent city of Richmond from the portion of the city in which he resided under Richmond's system of nine wards.


== Mayor of Richmond (1998–2001) ==
He was elected mayor of Richmond by the city council in 1998. (Until 2004, the mayor of Richmond was chosen by the city council from among its membership; under the present system, the mayor is chosen by popular vote.) He spent seven years on the city council, including two terms as mayor.
Under Kaine's leadership, Richmond saw the construction of its first new schools in a generation, tax cuts, and a reduction in the city’s crime rate. Richmond’s success in reducing violent crime, including a 55 percent drop in the city's homicide rate during his tenure, earned national recognition from Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Richmond's economic success during Kaine’s tenure earned the city its first-ever listing in Forbes magazine’s annual ranking of the top 10 cities in America for doing business.
As mayor, Kaine gained national attention following the implementation of a gun law known as Project Exile, an initiative that moved trials for armed defendants to federal court, which has stiffer sentencing guidelines.
During his tenure as mayor, Kaine drew criticism for designating public funds for an anti-gun-violence rally. After a constituent raised concerns about the funding at a Richmond City Council meeting, Kaine raised the money privately and reimbursed the city.


== Lieutenant governor (2002–2005) ==
In the Virginia general elections of November 2001, Kaine ran for lieutenant governor and won with 925,974 votes (50.35%). His opponents were Republican state Delegate Jay Katzen, with 883,886 votes (48.06%) and Libertarian Gary Reams, with 28,783 votes (1.57%). Kaine was inaugurated on January 12, 2002. As lieutenant governor, he also served as president of the Virginia Senate.


== 2005 gubernatorial election ==

In 2005, Kaine ran for and won the office of governor of Virginia in the November general election, defeating Republican former Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore with 52% of the vote to Kilgore's 46%.
An underdog for most of the race, Kaine led in some polls for the first time in October 2005, and held his lead into the final week before the election. While the previous Democratic governor, Mark Warner, was credited with doing especially well for a Democrat in rural areas of the commonwealth, Kaine's win featured surprising triumphs in traditionally Republican areas such as Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and the Northern Virginia exurbs of Prince William County and Loudoun County, as well as impressive showings in Democratic strongholds such as Richmond and Norfolk.
Kaine closely associated himself with popular outgoing Democratic Governor Mark Warner during his campaign; he won his race with a slightly smaller portion of the vote than Warner did, but achieved a slightly wider margin on account of the third-party candidate's comparatively greater success in 2005. A number of factors, from the poll numbers of President George W. Bush to public reaction to the death penalty ads run by Kilgore, have also been cited as contributing to his decisive win. Kaine was inaugurated in Williamsburg on January 14, 2006. Upon his inauguration, he became the first Catholic governor in Virginia history.


== Governor of Virginia (2006–2010) ==


=== Democratic response to State of the Union address ===
On January 31, 2006, Kaine gave the Democratic response to President Bush's 2006 State of the Union address. In his response, he argued that the Republicans failed to support bipartisanship in Washington and he condemned Bush's spending increases and tax cuts as "reckless".


=== Budget special session ===
In March 2006, after the Virginia General Assembly failed to come up with a budget, Kaine called for a special session that continued until June. The debate was over transportation issues and how to fund current and new projects. Most of the debate originated in a struggle within the Republican-controlled Senate and House of Delegates. In 2007, however, a transportation bill was passed and signed into law by Kaine.


=== Conservation ===
In May 2006, Governor Kaine announced his plan to protect 400,000 acres (1,600 km2) of Virginia land from development before the end of his service as Governor of Virginia. Kaine's conservation efforts focus on encouraging landowners to donate protective easements that restrict development. As of 2007, according to government statistics, Maryland spends as much as $21 per capita on land conservation, while Virginia spends $1.45. On the other hand, Virginia also has a higher proportion of its total land area under permanent protection than many other states, with about 13.69% of it currently protected.


=== Smoking ===
In October 2006, Kaine signed an executive order banning smoking in all government buildings and state-owned cars as of January 1, 2007. He signed legislation banning smoking in restaurants and bars, with some exceptions, in March 2009, making Virginia the first Southern state to do so.


=== Civil War records ===
Kaine announced that Virginia would be the first state to digitize records from the Civil War Era Freedmen's Bureau. This would facilitate research into post-Civil War African-American history.


=== HPV vaccinations ===

In 2007, large bipartisan majorities in the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a law that mandated HPV vaccine immunization for all sixth-grade girls in Virginia. It included a provision allowing parents to opt out of the requirement without citing a reason. After expressing "some qualms", Kaine signed the bill into law saying that "The particular language that ended up in the bill is fine. It's very broad, and people get information about the health benefits and any health concerns about the vaccination, and they get to make their own decisions. I think that is the right balance." Virginia was the second state to enact such legislation, following Texas.


=== Virginia Tech shooting ===
When news of the Virginia Tech shootings broke, Kaine canceled a trade mission to Japan and India to attend to the situation. Kaine spoke at the convocation held in Blacksburg the day after the shooting in which he invoked the Biblical story of Job. Kaine said he would appoint a panel of independent law-enforcement officials to determine what the university knew about the student responsible for the massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 32 people.
The commission, led by former Virginia State Police Superintendent Gerald Massengill and former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, began work on April 28, 2007, and issued its findings and recommendations on August 30, 2007. On April 30, 2007, Governor Kaine signed an executive order instructing state agencies to step up efforts to block gun sales to people involuntarily committed to inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment centers. Kaine's quick return to the state and his handling of the issue received widespread praise.


=== Metro ===
In July 2007, during the debate on the Silver Line of the Washington Metro through Tysons Corner, Kaine supported an elevated track solution in preference to a tunnel, citing costs and potential delays that would put federal funding at risk.


=== Education ===
During the 2008 General Assembly session, Governor Kaine backed a $22 million proposal to make pre-kindergarten education more accessible to at-risk four-year-olds.


=== Omeish resignation ===
Kaine appointed Esam Omeish to the Virginia Commission on Immigration, which was examining whether Virginia should do more to restrict illegal immigration. In September 2007, Omeish resigned as a commission member—as requested by Kaine—three hours after remarks made by Omeish on a call-in show on WRVA radio in Richmond were brought to Kaine's attention, specifically his criticisms of the Israel lobby and call for Bush's impeachment on account of the Iraq War. "I have been made aware of certain statements he has made which concern me," Kaine said in accepting Omeish's resignation. Kaine added that background checks would be more thorough in the future.


=== Coal power plant ===
Kaine's support of a coal-fired power plant in Wise County that would emit an estimated 5.4 million tons of carbon dioxide per year was opposed by environmentalists.


=== Cabinet ===
Chief of Staff — William Leighty (2006–2007), Wayne Turnage (2007–2010)
Secretary of Administration – Viola Baskerville (2006–2010)

== 2008 vice presidential speculation ==

Kaine was considered as a possible running mate for Barack Obama in 2008, but was not chosen. Kaine first supported Senator Obama's presidential bid in February 2007. It was maintained that Kaine's endorsement was the first from a statewide elected official outside of Illinois. Since Kaine was a relatively popular governor of a southern state, there was media speculation that he was a potential nominee for Vice President. Obama had supported Kaine in his campaign for governor and had said about him: "Tim Kaine has a message of fiscal responsibility and generosity of spirit. That kind of message can sell anywhere." On July 28, 2008, Politico reported that Kaine was "very, very high" on Obama's shortlist for vice president, a list which also included then Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, Governor Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, and Senator Joe Biden of Delaware. Obama ultimately selected Biden to become the vice-presidential nominee.


== Democratic Party chair (2009–2011) ==
In January 2009, Kaine became the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. He took the position at the request of President Obama, and during his tenure he oversaw a significant expansion of the party's grassroots focus through Organizing for America.
In February 2011, it was reported that President Obama had joined Wisconsin's budget battle and would oppose the Republican anti-union bill. The Washington Post reported that Organizing for America, the political operation for the White House, got involved after Kaine spoke to union leaders in Madison. They made phone calls, sent emails, and distributed messages via Facebook and Twitter to work on building crowds for the rallies.


== United States Senate ==


=== 2012 election ===

Kaine announced on April 5, 2011 that he would run for United States Senate in 2012, following Senator Jim Webb's decision not to seek re-election. Kaine filmed announcement videos in English and Spanish. Kaine was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. Kaine defeated former Senator and Governor George Allen in the general election. Mike Henry was chosen as Kaine's campaign manager.


=== Tenure ===
Kaine was sworn in for a six-year term on January 3, 2013, reuniting him with Mark Warner, the senior senator. When Warner was governor of Virginia, Kaine was his lieutenant governor.
On 11 June 2013, Kaine delivered a speech on the Senate floor in support of the bi-partisan "Gang of Eight" immigration bill. The speech was entirely in Spanish, marking the first time a Senator had ever made a speech on the Senate floor in a language other than English.
In July 2013, Kaine was named chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Armed Services
Subcommittee on Personnel
Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support
Subcommittee on Seapower

Committee on the Budget
Committee on Foreign Relations


== 2016 vice presidential speculation ==

Kaine endorsed Hillary Clinton's presidential bid in 2014, and campaigned actively for Clinton in seven states during the primaries. He has been the subject of considerable speculation as a possible running mate for Clinton, with several news reports indicating that he is at or near the top of Clinton's list of people under consideration, alongside figures such as Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro.


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Kaine, a Roman Catholic, is for religious reasons privately against abortion, but opposes overturning Roe v. Wade. On his 2012 Senate campaign website he says, "I strongly support the right of women to make their own health and reproductive decisions and, for that reason, will oppose efforts to weaken or subvert the basic holding of Roe v. Wade."
Kaine asserts that he has encouraged policymakers to focus on bringing down the number of abortions by reducing teen pregnancy through abstinence-focused education, ensuring women's access to health care and contraception, and promoting adoption. He supports some legal restrictions on abortion, such as requiring parental consent and banning late term abortions in cases where the woman's life is not at risk.


=== Afghanistan and ISIL ===
On the issue of the war in Afghanistan, Tim Kaine's website states "The main mission in Afghanistan—destroying Al Qaeda—is nearly complete and we should bring our troops home as quickly as we can, consistent with the need to make sure that Afghanistan poses no danger in the broader region."
In November 2014, at the Halifax International Security Forum, Kaine together with Senator John McCain emphasized the necessity of Congressional authorization for military operations against ISIS. "You just can't have a war without Congress", Kaine declared in Halifax.
On December 11, 2014 after a five-month campaign by Kaine, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved by 10–8 (straight party lines) a measure authorizing military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), but barring the use of ground troops.


=== Capital punishment ===
Despite his personal opposition to capital punishment, often cited during the 2005 campaign by both sides, Kaine oversaw eleven executions as governor, including the execution of John Allen Muhammad, the Beltway Sniper, on November 10, 2009. He has vetoed eight death-penalty expansion bills although some of the vetoes were overturned, and opposed the electric chair as an option. On June 9, 2008, Kaine commuted the death sentence of Percy Levar Walton to life in prison without parole.


=== Healthcare ===
Kaine supported passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare. On this issue, Kaine said, “I was a supporter and remain a supporter of the Affordable Care Act. I felt like it was a statement that we were going to put some things in the rear view mirror."
On September 27, 2013, Kaine voted to restore funding for ObamaCare as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days, and which also omitted House-passed language prioritizing debt payments if Congress fails to increase the nation’s borrowing limits.


=== LGBT rights ===
When talking about gay marriage in 2005, Kaine said that "No couples in Virginia can adopt other than a married couple — that's the right policy. Gay individuals should be able to adopt." In 2011, however, Kaine would change his position and become more open to the idea of adoption. Kaine said he believed that the judges would be able to make effective case-by-case analyses when dealing with unmarried couples applying to be possible parents. He said that he was open to consideration being made available to all couples, gay or straight.
On May 8, 2012 Kaine said that "There should be a license that would entitle a committed couple to the same rights as a married couple." In March 2013, Kaine announced his support of same-sex marriage.


=== Local issues ===
Kaine supports some "smart growth"–style policies to manage sprawl and transportation issues; he refers to these plans as "balanced growth".


=== Taxes ===
Kaine says that he supports allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for those with high incomes. Kaine also stated during a debate that he would be open to establishing a minimum tax that everyone must pay.
In 2012, Kaine supported raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes. He said: "For Social Security, we can raise the income payroll tax cap so that it covers a similar percentage of income as it did in the 1980s under President Reagan, which would greatly extend the solvency of the program."
Kaine supports introducing an internet sales tax that would require online retailers to collect the same sales taxes that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers currently collect.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Comfortable with same-sex marriage **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: Neither governments nor corporations have any right to decide about sexual preferences. Give same-sex partners the same status as heterosexual partners, and give same-sex marriages the same status as traditional marriage. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Homosexuals should be treated with equal respect as other members of society, not treated as criminals. You acknowledge the diversity of our society by including same-sex partners in most or all benefits of heterosexual marriage partners, but civil unions are preferable to using the term 'marriage.' 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Homosexuality is a lifestyle _choice_, and therefore those who choose it should live by the consequences of their choice. Marriage between a man and a woman is the central institution of American society - we shouldn't do anything that perverts that concept or threatens that ideal. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Homosexuality is immoral. You believe that the 'Gay Agenda' seeks to normalize homosexual activity and make it part of the mainstream as 'just another lifestyle.' We must draw the line so that homosexual values are not imposed upon our children. 

This question is looking for your views on gay rights. However you answer the
above question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Allow gay marriage
  * Allow gays to serve openly in the military
  * More support for AIDS research
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of gay equality. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** improvements in civil rights for gays. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe that society needs **practical** restrictions on gay rights to foster family development. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the biblical **principle** of restricting homosexual activity. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

### Gay Rights

**_LGBT**_

  * "GLBT" refers to gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender rights. At the core of the "T" component is what pro-gay activists is a person's "gender identity," which means that a person defines their own gender rather than their biology at birth. Using the term GLBT implies support for expanding gay rights to transgendered individuals, who are currently not covered by most laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination. In 32 states, there is no protection from being fired for simply being transgendered. **_Don't-Ask-Don't-Tell**_

  * The Clinton administration in 1993 enacted a dont ask/dont tell (DADT) policy for gays in the military. Under the DADT rules, gays could be discharged from the military for homosexual contact and for stating their sexual orientation, but the military is not allowed to ask them their orientation. 

  * The DADT policy was repealed in 2010; since then, gays may serve openly in the military. Hence gay and lesbian people may now openly serve in the US military. Since 1993, the DADT policy held that homosexuals may serve as long as they do not announce their homosexuality ("Don't Tell"), but also that the military may not investigate their homosexuality ("Don't Ask"). 

  * The policy banning open homosexuals serving in the military was repealed on Sept. 20, 2011. Hence gay and lesbian people may now openly serve in the US military.  
  
  
**_Family and Relationships**_

* **Adoption:** 19 states allow gay and lesbian couples to adopt children in a complex and expensive two-step process, in which one parent first adopts and then the second can petition for joint rights. 

* **Ceremonial Marriages:** Same Sex Marriages may be officiated by church officials, or anyone else, but ceremonial marriages in and of themselves involve no civil laws and carry no legal benefits or responsibilities. 

* **Domestic Partnership Registration:** is a means by which some cities allow opposite- and same-sex couples to go on public record as a non-married couple. The major benefit is used to establish legal responsibility for debts after a relationship ends. 

* **Domestic Partnership Affidavit:** Many private employers and municipalities offer domestic partner benefits to their workers, based on signing a legal affidavit that defines an economic relationship.    
  
**_Civil Unions**_

* In Dec. 1999, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed a 1996 ruling, and defined marriage as between different sex couples. 

* In April 2000, the Vermont House of Representatives gave final approval to same-sex marriages. Gays and lesbians may join in "civil unions," which are no expected to be recognized by other states and will not entitle the partners to federal benefits. The Vermont Supreme Court had ruled in December that gay and lesbian couples denied the right to marry were suffering from unconstitutional discrimination. 

* In June 2000, the Supreme Court let stand a New Jersey ruling that allowed the Boy Scouts to ban gay scoutmasters. 

* In July 2000, Vermont began offering a separate form of marriage, conferring about 300 spousal rights to same sex couples. 

* The Civil Union license is obtained from town clerks. There is a $20 fee. The Unions are "certified" either by justices of the peace, judge, or willing member of the clergy. Civil Union couples also have the right to dissolve their unions through a "dissolution" process in Family Court.   
  
**_Civil Unions Benefits**_

* **Definitions:** Use of State laws that confer benefits or rights to people based on their marital or family status, such as family landowner rights to hunt and fish, or definitions of family farmers. 

* **Adoption:** Entitled to all the protections and benefits available when adopting. Same-sex couples already are allowed to adopt, but laws would reflect that those couples would now be treated as spouses. 

* **Compensation:** Use of victims' compensation and workers' compensation related to spouses. 

* **Discrimination:** Use of laws prohibiting discrimination based on marital status. 

* **Health Care:** Able to make medical decisions for incapacitated partner. Able to visit hospitals visitation and be notified of a partner's condition. 

* **Insurance:** State employees are treated as spouses for insurance or continuing care contracts. 

* **Lawsuits:** Able to sue for wrongful death, the emotional distress caused by a partner's death or injury, and loss of consortium caused by death or injury. 

* **Property:** Entitled to joint title, transfer from one to the other on death, and property transfer tax benefits. 

* **Probate:** Use probate law and procedures. 

* **State Tax:** Treated as an economic unit. 

* **Testimony:** Not be compelled to testify against one another.   
  
**_Federal rights NOT Covered by Civil Unions**_

* **Immigration Rights:** Cannot have a non-U.S. spouse become a full citizen. 

* **Social Security:** Cannot collect benefits upon death of a spouse. 

* **Federal Taxes:** Cannot file jointly as a married couple   
  
**_Same-sex Marriage**_

* **Goodridge v. Department of Public Health:** The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in Nov. 2003 that cities must issue same-sex marriage licenses. The first such license was issues in Cambridge Massachusetts on May 17, 2004. 

* **1913 Law:** A Massachusetts law from 1913, targeting miscegeny or mixed-race marriage, required that residents of other states be legally marriageable in their home state, in order to qualify in Massachusetts. This law has prevented same-sex couples from elsewhere marrying in Massachusetts. In Feb. 2007, Rhode Island became the first state to accept same-sex marriage licenses from Massachusetts (despite that same-sex couples cannot marry in Rhode Island itself). 

* **California**'s Supreme Court enabled same-sex marriage in a ruling on May 15, 2008, overturning a statewide ban, citing a 1948 reversal of a ban on interracial marriages (but later overturned the law). 

* **Connecticut**'s Supreme Court enabled same-sex marriage in a ruling on Oct. 10, 2008, replacing CT's civil union law. 

* **State DOMA:** Largely as a result of the Massachusetts law, 29 states banned same-sex marriage. The laws are known as 'Defense of Marriage Amendments'. Several 2004 & 2008 ballot initiatives brought out enough voters to not only pass state DOMA laws, but to influence the Congressional and/or presidential election. The issue retains high interest in the 2012 presidential race. 

* **Federal DOMA:** refers to the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress in 1996, which defined marriage as consisting of one man and one woman (in other words, barring same-sex marriage). DOMA applies to all federal benefits and taxes, but not necessarily to state benefits and taxes. 

* In May 2012, a federal appeals court in Boston ruled that DOMA unconstitutionally denies benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. The ruling supports the Obama administration's 2011 announcement that it considered the law unconstitutional and no longer would defend it. 

* On March 27, 2013, the Supreme Court heard _US v. Windsor_ on overturning DOMA, and on June 26, 2013, overturned key components of DOMA as unconstitutional. DOMA was declared to violate the equal protection clause, and establishes that same-sex married couples are entitled to equal federal benefits as all married couples. 

* **Domestic Partnership:** 11 states have some sort of civil union or domestic partnership law for same-sex couples. 

* As of the 2012 election, 11 states --CA, CO, HI, ME, MD, NV, OR, RI, WI, IL, and WA -- have domestic partnership laws. 

* As of the 2012 election, 1 state -- NJ -- has a civil union law. 

* As of the 2012 election, 3 states -- MA, CA, and CT -- have same-sex marriage laws. 

* As of the 2012 election,13 states allowed same-sex civil unions or had some similar legislation, and 29 states had laws defining marriage as one-man-one-woman. By the 2014 election, the number of states allowing same-sex marriage had risen to 34 states. Several more states have legalized same-sex marriage but it has not yet taken effect (but will by the 2016 election). With a majority of states having legalized same-sex marriage, at issue now is federal law, which includes numerous aspects of federal benefits. 

  
  
**_Societal Issues**_

* **Boy Scouts:** In June 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts of America can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders. 

* **Don't Ask, Don't Tell:** The Clinton administration in 1993 enacted a "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Under the existing rules, gays can be discharged from the military for homosexual contact and for stating their sexual orientation, but the military is not allowed to ask them their orientation.
