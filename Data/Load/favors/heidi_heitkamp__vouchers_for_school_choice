Mary Kathryn "Heidi" Heitkamp (born October 30, 1955) is the junior United States Senator from North Dakota, in office since 2013, and a member of the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party. She was the 28th North Dakota Attorney General, serving from 1993 to 2001, and State Tax Commissioner from 1989 to 1993.
Heitkamp was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in the 2000 gubernatorial election, losing to John Hoeven. She considered a bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2010 U.S. Senate election to replace retiring Senator Byron Dorgan, but on March 3, 2010, declined the rematch against Hoeven, who was ultimately elected.
In November 2011, Heitkamp declared her candidacy to replace Kent Conrad as U.S. Senator from North Dakota in the 2012 election. She narrowly defeated Republican Congressman Rick Berg on November 6, 2012, in that year's closest Senate race, with Berg conceding the next day. She is North Dakota's second female senator, after Jocelyn Burdick, and the first to be elected.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
Heitkamp was born in Breckenridge, Minnesota, the fourth of seven children of Doreen LaVonne (née Berg) and Raymond Bernard Heitkamp. Her father was of German descent, while her mother is of half Norwegian and half German ancestry. Heitkamp was raised in Mantador, North Dakota. She earned a B.A. from the University of North Dakota in 1977 and a J.D. from Lewis and Clark Law School in 1980.
In 1980-81, she was an attorney for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. She next worked for the Office of the North Dakota State Tax Commissioner as an attorney. In 1986, incumbent State Tax Commissioner Kent Conrad decided to retire in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Heitkamp ran for the position and won the statewide election with 66% of the vote against Republican Marshall Moore. She served in that position until 1992.


== Attorney General ==
In 1992, the incumbent North Dakota Attorney General, Democrat Nick Spaeth, decided to retire in order to run for governor of North Dakota. Heitkamp ran for the position and won with 62% of the vote. In 1996, she won reelection with 64% of the vote.
Heitkamp's best-known achievement as Attorney General of North Dakota was to lead the state's legal efforts against tobacco companies, which resulted in the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. This provides for the tobacco companies to pay the state funds to be applied to health care costs.


== 2000 gubernatorial election ==

In 2000, incumbent Republican Governor Ed Schafer decided not to seek a third term. Heitkamp ran and was unopposed in the primary. On the Republican side, John Hoeven, CEO of Bank of North Dakota, also ran unopposed. During her campaign for governor it was announced that Heitkamp had been diagnosed with breast cancer, which is now in remission. Hoeven defeated her 55% to 45%. Heitkamp won 12 of the state's 53 counties.


== Business career (2001–2011) ==
Heitkamp served as the director of Dakota Gasification Company's Great Plains Synfuels Plant from 2001 to 2012.  Her brother, Joel, is a radio talk-show host and former North Dakota state senator. Heitkamp has occasionally filled in for her brother as host of his program, News and Views, which is broadcast on Clear Channel stations in North Dakota.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== 2012 election ===

In January 2011, incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Kent Conrad announced his intent to retire instead of seeking a fourth full term in 2012. On November 8, 2011, she announced that she would seek the open seat. She vowed to be "an independent voice."
Heitkamp was attacked in commercials for accepting campaign contributions from a trial lawyer, Jack McConnell, Jr., assigned by her to help North Dakota implement its settlement with tobacco companies when she served as state attorney general. She released an ad to respond to these allegations. 
Heitkamp won the November 6, 2012, Senate election by 2,994 votes, less than 1% of the ballots cast. Berg conceded the race the next day. If he had not, the race could have been subject to a "demand recount" under North Dakota law, which permits candidates to demand a recount if they lose an election by more than 0.5% but less than 2% of the vote cast for the candidate receiving the most votes for the office sought. Upon winning the election, Heitkamp became North Dakota's second female U.S. Senator. She serves alongside her former gubernatorial opponent John Hoeven.

== Political positions ==


=== Health care ===
Heitkamp has said that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains "good and bad" and "it needs to be fixed." She criticized her Senate opponent Rick Berg for wanting to repeal the law, citing concerns about insurance companies denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions. Berg and the NRSC criticized Heitkamp for offering unqualified support for the health care law until she ran for the Senate in 2011, citing footage of her at a 2010 rally where she called the bill "a legacy vote" without any criticism of it.
During the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Heitkamp criticized Republican attempts to use the Continuing Appropriations Resolution as "a vehicle to legislate other issues," such as the defunding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a delay of its individual mandate. Heitkamp was one of 14 members of the bipartisan Senate group that negotiated the compromise that was the basis of the eventual deal to end the shutdown. During the government shutdown in 2013 Heitkamp donated about $8,000 of her salary to North Dakota charities that support veterans, provide healthcare supplies to those that cannot afford them, and raise Breast Cancer awareness.


=== Spending ===
Heitkamp said she would support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution "with exceptions" if elected. Heitkamp said such exceptions would include wartime spending, Social Security, Medicare, and a ban on tax cuts for those making more than $1 million per year.


=== Taxes ===
Heitkamp announced in a campaign press release in 2012 that she supports the Buffett Rule. Heitkamp supports implementing the Buffett Rule via the Paying a Fair Share Act, which would require those making a gross income of $1,000,000 or more to pay at least a 30% federal tax rate.


=== Filibuster reform ===
Heitkamp said she supports reforming the filibuster in the United States Senate, but did not specifically endorse the Merkley/Udall/Harkin proposal for doing so.


=== Energy ===
Heitkamp said she supports the Keystone XL pipeline because it will create jobs, decrease America's dependence on foreign oil from the Middle East, and help drive down the national debt. She also said many who oppose hydraulic fracturing have been exposed to "junk science" and do not know what it really is. She was Climate Hawks Vote's lowest-rated Democratic senator on climate leadership in the 113th Congress and remains among the lowest in 2015.


=== Same-sex marriage ===
On April 5, 2013, Heitkamp announced her support of same-sex marriage, along with fellow Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly (D-Indiana), who entered the Senate the same time Heitkamp did. Both are Roman Catholics.


=== Gun control ===
On April 11, 2013, Heitkamp explained in an interview that she intended to vote against the Manchin-Toomey amendment introduced in the Senate after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which would have amended the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to expand background checks to gun shows and internet purchases. Heitkamp said, "I'm going to represent my state. ... in the end it's not what any other senator believes. It's about what the people of North Dakota believe." Polling suggests that the majority of North Dakotans approve of prohibiting individuals on the No-Fly list from buying firearms and ammunition, but in June 2016, after the Orlando nightclub mass shooting, Heitkamp voted against such a prohibition. She was the only Democratic senator to do so. She instead appeared in support of a "compromise gun bill" proposed by Susan Collins.


== Personal life ==
Heitkamp is married to Darwin Lange, a family practitioner. They reside in Mandan and are the parents of two adult children, Ali and Nathan.

** Vouchers for school choice **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: The government should not be in the business of running schools. State-funded vouchers should pay for privately-run education at private schools, parochial schools, charter schools, home-schooling, or whatever schools parents choose. Bush's "No Child Left Behind" act sets the stage for terminating failing schools. 
  * **Support** means you believe: School choice helps the poor who would otherwise be stuck in failing schools. Why should only the elite be able to afford private school? Subsidize parents' school choices to foster equality, as long as the school respects separation of church and state, and meets basic state standards. Charter schools are a good compromise. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Continue experimenting with charter schools, and with public school choice, but only as a limited experiment, and no vouchers. We should create pressure to improve our public schools, not abandon them. Bush's "No Child Left Behind" act is an unfunded mandate. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Public schools are an important component of American society. Improve public schools rather than destroying them with vouchers. More teachers, smaller classes, more funding - then parents will _choose_ public schools. 

This question is looking for your views on how large a role the government
should play in running our school systems. However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Extend school choice to private as well as public schools 
  * Allow taxes to fund parochial schools 
  * Extend charter schools nationwide

* Support "No Child Left Behind" 

How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of limiting government's role in schooling. 
  * **Support** means you believe in school choice for **practical** reasons of improving education. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe more **practical** improvements could be made by focusing on public school improvement. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of public education. 
****BACKGROUND**

### School Choice

School Choice generally refers to a school district allowing parents to decide
which school within the district to send their kids to. The political issue is
whether to allow the choice to include private schools, parochial schools, and
home schooling at taxpayer expense. Taxpayer funding of parochial schools
potentially violates the Constitutional separation of church and state.
Taxpayer funding of private schools is controversial because it subsidizes
parents who are currently paying for private schools themselves, and are
usually more wealthy than the average public school family.

### Charter Schools

Charter schools are publicly-funded and publicly-controlled schools which are
privately run. They are usually required to adhere to fewer district rules
than regular public schools.

### Vouchers

Vouchers are a means of implementing school choice -- parents are given a
voucher by the school district, which entitles them to, say, $4,000 applicable
to either public school or private school tuition. The value of the voucher is
generally lower than the cost of one year of public education (which averages
$5,200), so private schools (where tuition averages $8,500) may require cash
payment in addition to the voucher.

### Education Buzzwords

Generally, any reference to standards, or especially to dealing with failing
schools, implies support of school vouchers. Generally, any reference to
smaller classrooms, or especially to building public schools, implies
opposition to funding private schools. Further decoding of education buzzwords
are detailed under [Education](../Background_Education.htm).
