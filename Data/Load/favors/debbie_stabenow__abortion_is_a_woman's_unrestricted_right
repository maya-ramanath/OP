Deborah Ann "Debbie" Greer Stabenow (born April 29, 1950) is the senior United States Senator from Michigan and a member of the Democratic Party. Before her election to the U.S. Senate, she was a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Michigan's 8th congressional district from 1997 to 2001. She previously served as a member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, Michigan House of Representatives, and Michigan Senate.
Stabenow served as Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee 2011-2015. She was re-elected to the seat for a third term in November 2012. She became the state's senior senator upon the retirement of Carl Levin on January 3, 2015.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
Stabenow was born in Gladwin, Michigan, the daughter of Anna Merle (née Hallmark) and Robert Lee Greer. She grew up in Clare, Michigan. She graduated from Clare High School, and received a Bachelor of Arts from Michigan State University in 1972 and a Master of Social Work magna cum laude from Michigan State University in 1975.


== Early political career ==


=== Ingham County politics ===
While in graduate school, Stabenow won her first election to public office: the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, a position in which she served from 1975 to 1978.


=== State legislature ===
She served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1979 to 1990, where she became the first woman to preside over the House. She also served in the Michigan Senate from 1991 to 1994.


=== 1994 gubernatorial election ===

In 1994, she ran for Governor of Michigan in the Democratic primary, for the opportunity to challenge incumbent Republican John Engler. However, U.S. Congressman Howard Wolpe defeated her in the primary with a plurality of 35% to Stabenow's 30%. After the primary, Wolpe chose Stabenow as his running mate, and she appeared on the general election ballot as the Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor. Stabenow failed to become Lieutenant Governor of Michigan as Engler defeated Wolpe 61%-38%.


=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
In 1996, she decided to run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. She challenged incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Dick Chrysler of Michigan's 8th congressional district. She defeated him 54%-44%. In 1998, she won re-election to a second term with 57% of the vote.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== Elections ===
2000

She did not seek re-election in 2000 in order to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham. She won the Democratic primary unopposed. She was considered the underdog for much of the Senate race, but rallied in the final weeks. She defeated him 49.5%-48%, a difference of 67,259 votes.
2006

Stabenow was challenged by Republican Michael Bouchard, Oakland County sheriff and former State Senate Majority Leader. Stabenow defeated him 57%-41%.
2012

Stabenow was unopposed in the Democratic primary and defeated Republican nominee Pete Hoekstra, former U.S. representative. Stabenow won 59% to Hoekstra's 38%.


=== Tenure ===
Before her current committee assignments, Senator Stabenow also served on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the Special Committee on Aging.
Stabenow is only the second person from Michigan to have served in both houses of the Michigan State Legislature and in both houses of the United States Congress. Stabenow is also the first person to have served as a Michigan state legislator to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate (until enactment of the Seventeenth amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, U.S. Senators were selected by the state legislature). No former Michigan state legislator had served in the U.S. Senate since 1894, when Francis B. Stockbridge died.
Stabenow became the third-ranking Democratic Party member in the U.S. Senate on November 16, 2004, when she was elected as secretary of the Democratic caucus. As caucus secretary, she assisted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) to set the Democratic agenda and priorities. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) was elected Minority Whip, the second-ranking Democratic spot. In November 2006, Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that Stabenow would leave the caucus secretary position to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, charged with "engag[ing] Democratic Senators and community leaders across the country in an active dialogue".
Following the withdrawal of Tom Daschle as President Barack Obama's nominee as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Organization for Women endorsed Stabenow for the position and urged the president to appoint Stabenow, saying, "Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) has long focused on health care as a priority, and with her background as a social worker she is well positioned to take the helm of this agency that is so critical to women and families."
Stabenow became the Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2011, following the defeat of Chairwoman Blanche Lincoln. A controversial item during Stabenow's tenure, has been the renewal and reform of the 2012 U.S. Farm Bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) demonstrated his commitment to working on a new five-year Farm Bill by reintroducing 2012's Senate Farm Bill in the new 113th Congress in January 2013. Senator Reid indicated that the Farm Bill is on his top priority list, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Stabenow has voiced support for Reid’s move stating, "Majority Leader Reid has demonstrated that the Senate will once again make supporting our nation’s agriculture economy while cutting spending a top priority." 
On October 29, 2014, Stabenow introduced the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act (S. 1603; 113th Congress), a bill that would reaffirm the status of lands taken into trust by the Department of the Interior (DOI) for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band. The bill would clarify that the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band's land trust could not be challenged in court under the Supreme Court decision of Carcieri v. Salazar.


=== Committee assignments ===

Committee on Finance
Subcommittee on Health Care
Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness

== Political positions ==
Fairness doctrine
Stabenow has expressed support in regulating talk radio via a measure like the Fairness doctrine. On February 5, 2009, she stated "I think it’s absolutely time to pass a standard. Now, whether it’s called the Fairness Standard, whether it’s called something else — I absolutely think it’s time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves." Her support for these measures has been met with criticism about a conflict of interest, given that the primary target is conservative talk radio and that her former husband, Tom Athans, has been an executive at a number of liberal progressive talk radio networks, such as Air America
Drilling in the Great Lakes
She authored the first law to ban drilling in the Great Lakes.
On August 31, 2006, Stabenow, along with Senator Carl Levin and Rep. John Dingell, announced an agreement that would completely cease Ontario's dumping of solid waste in Michigan within four years. This has been an issue in Michigan for the past several years. Previously in the Senate, Stabenow wrote legislation intended to reduce the dumping of Canadian trash into Michigan by requiring machines to search trash being dumped across the border. In July 2006, the Senate unanimously passed a law sponsored by Stabenow requiring the payment of $420 inspection fee for every truckload of Canadian trash being brought into Michigan.
Global warming
On August 10, 2009, Stabenow was reported by The Detroit News as saying "Global warming creates volatility. I feel it when I'm flying. The storms are more volatile. We are paying the price in more hurricanes and tornadoes." However, she has opposed regulation of greenhouse gases, enhanced fuel efficiency standards in California, and greenhouse gas emission reporting standards.
Health care reform
Stabenow supported President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; she voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and she voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. She also sponsored S. 2257: Excellence in Mental Health Act.
Defense
Stabenow voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 in December 2011, which included highly controversial provisions drafted by Senators Carl Levin and John McCain in closed session, that allows for the indefinite military detention of American citizens who are deemed potential terrorists and enemies of the state without trial, challenging the general judicial status of "innocent until proven guilty."
Environment
In March 2011, the Think Progress website criticized Stabenow for joining “the pro-polluter frenzy sweeping the U.S. Senate, introducing legislation to permanently cripple Clean Air Act rules on global warming pollution. The legislation in question was the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S.493), which, according to Think Progress, was “being used as a vehicle for senators who wish to prevent regulation of greenhouse pollution from oil refineries, coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, and other major emitters. Stabenow has added her amendment to three others intended to hamstring the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of carbon polluters.”
Stabenow's proposed amendment to keep the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions for two years also draw criticism. The amendment would have given “coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and other industrial sources a two year exemption” from rules requiring them to report greenhouse gas emissions. Stabenow defended her position by saying “My amendment is a common-sense approach that allows protections from carbon pollution, determined by scientists and public health experts, to continue being developed while providing businesses the support and incentives they need as they reduce pollution, generate new clean energy technologies and create jobs.”
The Economy
In 2009, Stabenow voted for President Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan. In 2008, however, she voted against the bailout proposed by President Bush.
Same Sex Marriage
Stabenow is for the equal rights of the LGBT community in the U.S. On two separate occasions she has voted against the Constitutional Amendment, 2004 and 2006, to define marriage “as between one man and one woman". In 2006, Stabenow also voted NO on the constitutional ban of same sex marriage.


== Criticism ==
In 2009, Stabenow said, “I have always said that a strong, national fuel-economy standard is what our country needs, not a confusing patch work of different state standards. I am pleased that the Obama administration heeded my call and developed a national standard for our automakers to follow — a clear standard that will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil." However, an article from The Washington Independent states that her voting record "tells a different tale." In 2002, she voted against "a proposal that would have forced automakers to create vehicles with fleetwide averages of 40 miles-per-gallon by 2015 — 'a strong, national fuel economy standard'." Also, in June 2007, she voted against a bill that would mandate "fleet-wide averages of 35 mpg by 2020."


== Personal life ==
Stabenow was first married to Dennis Stabenow; the couple divorced in 1990. They have two children, Michelle and Todd.
In 2003, Stabenow married Tom Athans, now co-founder of Democracy Radio and former executive vice president of Air America. By this marriage, she has a stepdaughter, Gina. In 2008, Athans said to the police that he had used the internet “to make a date with a prostitute and paid her $150 for sex at a hotel” in Detroit. The news came about after police investigations into an internet-based prostitution ring operating in the hotel questioned Athans. Stabenow and Athans divorced on May 28, 2010, approximately two years after Athans was detained in Troy, Michigan, as part of a prostitution sting.
Stabenow belongs to the Grace United Methodist Church.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Abortion is a woman's unrestricted right **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe: Abortion is a private decision between a woman and her doctor. You believe in the `Right to Choose' and are strongly pro-choice. The right to abortion empowers women and is an important part of women's health rights and women's reproductive freedom. That right includes the right to a government subsidy for poor women who want an abortion. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Restricting `Partial-Birth Abortions' or other specific procedures is reasonable, but clinic access should be unfettered, since other women may choose differently than you. You are pro-choice, but believe that some restrictions are acceptable. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: The fetus is a human being who has rights independent of its mother's rights. You are "pro-life." While abortion under certain circumstances might be tolerated, the basic rights belong to the fetus, not the mother. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Abortion is immoral because it kills a human being, and should never be tolerated. `Roe v. Wade' should be overturned and we should protest abortion clinics as other forms of injustice are protested. 

This question is looking for your views on abortion rights in general.
However you answer the above question would be similar to your response to
these statements:

  * Uphold Roe v. Wade 
  * No Litmus Test for nominees 
  * Enforce Clinic Access laws 
  * Oppose Strict Constructionist judges 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of the right to choose. 
  * **Support** means you believe that abortions will occur anyway so we should make them safe for **practical** reasons. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe more **practical** limitations are appropriate to make abortions rarer. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that abortion violates the **principle** of taking a fetus' life. 

**BACKGROUND**

### Basic terminology of the abortion debate

  * **Roe v. Wade** refers to the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. 
  * **Right to Choose** refers to a pro-choice stance, upholding Roe v. Wade. 
  * **Right to Life** refers to a pro-life stance, seeking to overturn or limit Roe v. Wade 
  * Pro-life advocates refer to Roe v. Wade as an example of **Judicial Activism** or legislating from the bench, i.e., that judges are making the law rather than interpreting it. In these terms, pro-life advocates believe in **Strict Constructionism**, or a literal interpretation of the Constitution with no implied rights. 
  * A **Litmus test** requires Vice Presidential & Supreme Court nominees to agree with ones abortion view. 
  * **The Human Life Amendment** would be a Constitutional Amendment overturning Roe v. Wade. There is currently no such Amendment pending, but proponents regularly introduce **Human Life Bills** in Congress. 
  * **States Rights**: Most pro-life legislation aims at overturning Roe v. Wade, which means returning the decision about abortion to the states. In contrast, a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution would ban abortion in all states. Overturning Roe v. Wade would NOT ban abortion -- it would then become a state decision, with some states allowing abortion and some restricting or banning it. 
  * **Contraception** is the surprise issue of the 2012 election campaign. It became relevant because ObamaCare requires that employers provide health insurance for employees, including contraceptives. At issue is when the employer is a church or other organization morally opposed to contraception. Conservatives call this a freedom of religion issue; liberals call it a war on women. 

### Roe v. Wade

The essence of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision is that Constitutional rights
apply only after birth; hence abortion does not breach a persons right to
life. States cannot regulate 1st trimester abortions; states can regulate but
not ban 2nd trimester abortions; and states can ban 3rd trimester abortions
(as many have).

### Planned Parenthood v. Casey

The Casey decision refers to the 1992 Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The Supreme Court upheld the 1973 Roe
v. Wade decision which established the right to an abortion, but allowed
restrictions on abortion. The Court cited the right to privacy, as well as
stare decisis, which means that a longstanding legal precedent should not be
overturned without a good reason.

### Fetal Viability

The debate on abortion generally focuses on when human life begins. The courts
often focus on **viability**, the point at which the fetus could survive
outside the womb.  
\- Viability naturally begins at about 6 months of pregnancy, but with modern
medical advances the age of viability is pushed back substantially.  
\- Strong pro-life advocates believe that the fetus should be protected from
the moment of conception.

### Abortion Legislation

The details of abortion legislation focus on what the states can regulate and
what they can ban in later trimesters:

  * **Partial-Birth Abortion** refers to a late-term abortion method which induces a breech delivery and collapses the fetal skull before completing delivery. This procedure is banned in 24 states, but pro-choice advocates, including President Clinton, have sought to overturn state laws with a federal ruling.   
\- In April 2000, the Supreme Court rejected a Nebraska law banning partial
birth abortions.  
\- In June 2000, the Court said that the Nebraska ban was unconstitutional
because it had no exceptions and barred second trimester abortions.

  * Each state decides if **Parental Consent** is required for teenagers seeking abortions. The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that spousal consent cannot be required by the states. 
  * Each state also determines rules about **informed consent**, about 24-hour waiting periods, and about when viability occurs after the 1st trimester. 
  * In Nov. 2005, the Supreme Court heard the case Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood, on the issue of parental consent (its first abortion case since 2000). They ruled in 2006 that states may require parental involvement, but not when it risks the health of the minor. No precedents were overturned nor set. 
  * In April 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the ban, but allowed for future cases about how it is applied. 

### Stem Cell Research

  * **Stem Cells** are undifferentiated cells, which are useful in research for cloning and for treating many diseases. Stem cells are best taken from human fetuses; hence the pro-life opposition. Many pro-life advocates support fetal stem cell research because of the medical potential. In 2001, Pres. Bush announced that the federal policy would be to allow fetal stem cell research on existing stem cell lines but not on new ones. 
  * **Embryonic Stem Cells** are stem cells derived from embryos, newborn's umbilical cords, etc. The 2008 election debate focuses entirely on embryonic stem cell research, because adult stem cell research (with source cells from non-embryonic sources) is no longer controversial. 
  * Pro-life advocates generally oppose embryonic stem cell research because of its use of pre-born human source material. There are notable exceptions, however, such as Nancy Reagan and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R, UT) where otherwise pro-life people support embryonic stem cell research for its healthcare benefits. 
  * As with the rest of the abortion debate, defining the playing field has become important in stem cell research. Defining stem cells as a healthcare issue is a pro-research stance. Defining stem cells as an issue about sanctity of life (e.g., as related to human cloning) is an anti-research stance. 
  * Most relevantly to the 2008 elections, the terminology focuses on the term "embryonic". Anti-research advocates will usually say they are "pro-stem cell research," omitting the key term "embryonic" to avoid alienating victims of diseases that might be cured by embryonic research. pro-research advocates will often say they are "for ALL stem cell research," omitting the controversial term "embryonic" to avoid alienating pro-life voters. 
  * Voters can discern candidates' views on the issue by listening to how the candidate describes adult stem cell research. If the politician considers adult stem cell research just another form of stem cell research, morally equivalent to embryonic stem cell research, then they are pro-embryonic research. If the politician sings the praises of adult stem cell research, for example, specifyinh medical accomplishments that arose from ADULT stem cells, then they are anti-embryonic research. 

### Related Legislation

* **Clinic Access** laws refer to what pro-life protesters may and may not do at the entrances to abortion clinics, and how far away they must stay. Clinic access became an issue after several abortion clinics were bombed and several abortion doctors were shot in recent years. 
* **RU-486** is a drug that induces abortion in early pregnancy. In September 2000, after 12 years of study, the FDA approved the use of RU-486 until the 7th week of pregnancy. 
* **Cloning** is a rapidly advancing technology in which a fetus develops from only one parent. It has been successful in animals, and is entering trial stages with humans. Pro-life advocates generally oppose cloning on the same basis that they oppose abortion. 

### Buzzwords in the abortion debate

  * Describing abortion as a health issue or as a women's rights issue is a pro-choice stance. 
  * Describing abortion as a moral issue or as an issue of balancing the mother's rights with the fetus' rights, is a pro-life stance. 
  * Both sides of the abortion debate attempt to define the playing-field in their favor by terminology. The pro-life name for pro-choice proponents is "pro-abortion", and the pro-choice name for pro=life proponents is "anti-choice". Using either of those charged terms defines the speaker as strongly one-sided (hence this website uses the more neutral terms "pro-life" and "pro-choice"). 
  * Any reference to "the rights of the unborn is a strong pro-life stance, as is defining life from the moment of conception. 
  * Any reference to the rights of the mother is a strong pro-choice stance, as is defining a right to privacy" (between a woman and her doctor). 
  * As mentioned above, the most obscure buzzword is that supporting judicial activism implies a pro-choice stance, while supporting strict constructionism implies a pro-life stance. In nominations for Supreme Court justices, asking this question is the archetypical Litmus Test -- liberal Senators spent many hours questioning Clarence Thomas on whether he held a Strict Constructionist view of the Constitution (he did not admit so). 
  * For serious policy wonks, the most important abortion buzzword is Stare Decisis -- that is the basis upon which Clarence Thomas declined to rule against Roe v. Wade. Thomas meant that although he would have ruled against Roe v. Wade in 1973, he would not do so now because the 1973 Supreme Court ruling had been in force for a quarter century and hence has precedential weight.
