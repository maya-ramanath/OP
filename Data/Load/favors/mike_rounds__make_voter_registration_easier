=== Elections ===
2002

Rounds' victory in the 2002 Republican Gubernatorial Primary was one of South Dakota's greatest political upsets. Until late in 2001, then-Congressman John Thune was the front-runner for the nomination. When Thune passed on the race to challenge Senator Tim Johnson, state Attorney General Mark Barnett and former Lieutenant Governor Steve T. Kirby quickly became candidates.
However, the contest between Kirby and Barnett soon became very negative and dirty. Barnett attacked Kirby for not investing in companies based in South Dakota and for his involvement with Collagenesis, a company which removed skin from donated human cadavers and processed them for use. It became the subject of a massive scandal when it was revealed that the company was using the skins for much more lucrative cosmetic surgery like lip and penis enhancements while burn victims "lie waiting in hospitals as nurses scour the country for skin to cover their wounds, even though skin is in plentiful supply for plastic surgeons". Kirby invested in the company after the scandal broke and Barnett attacked him for it in television advertisements. However, the advertisements backfired because "the claims were so outlandish, that people thought for sure that they were exaggerated or completely fabricated."
After winning the Republican nomination, Rounds selected state senator Dennis Daugaard of Dell Rapids to be his running mate. Their Democratic opponents were University of South Dakota President Jim Abbott of Vermillion and his running mate, former state representative Mike Wilson of Rapid City.
Rounds was elected governor on November 5, 2002. The results were as follows:
Republicans: Mike Rounds and Dennis Daugaard– 56.8%
Democrats: Jim Abbott and Mike Wilson– 41.9%
Independent: Jim Carlson and Ron Bosch– 0.7%
Libertarians: Nathan Barton and Eric Risty– 0.6%
2006

Two Democratic candidates emerged to challenge Rounds: Jack Billion, a retired surgeon and former state legislator from Sioux Falls and Dennis Wiese, the former president of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Billion easily defeated Wiese for the nomination and selected Rapid City school board member Eric Abrahamson as his running mate.
The Rounds/Daugaard ticket was reelected on November 7, 2006. The results were as follows:
Republicans: Mike Rounds and Dennis Daugaard – 61.7%
Democrats: Jack Billion and Eric Abrahamson – 36.1%
Constitution: Steven J. Willis and Larry Johnsen – 1.2%
Libertarians: Tom Gerber and Betty Rose Ryan – 1.0%


=== Tenure ===
Rounds served as a member of the Governors' Council at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Rounds served as the 2008 Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association.


=== Issues ===


==== Research centers ====
Rounds's 2010 Initiative established 10 research centers at state-supported universities. In the first four years of the program, the state's first five research centers generated an estimated $59 million in federal and private funding, with an estimated $110 million economic impact for the state.


==== Abortion ====

On February 22, 2006, the state legislature of South Dakota passed an act banning all medical abortions except those necessary to save the mother's life (see double effect). Rounds signed the act on March 6 and the ban was to have taken effect on July 1, 2006, but never did because of a court challenge. A referendum for a potential repeal of H.B. 1215 was placed on the ballot for the November 2006 statewide election due to a successful petition. On May 30, over 38,000 signatures were filed, more than twice the 17,000 required to qualify. The law was ultimately repealed by voters on November 7, 2006, the day of Rounds' re-election.
According to a Survey USA poll released in January 2006, Rounds had an approval rating of 73% and a net approval rating of +52%, which placed him among the top five most popular governors. Following the abortion ban, again according to a SurveyUSA poll, Rounds' approval rating dropped 14% to 58%; his approval rebounded to 70% after the ban was repealed.


==== EB-5 Visa inquiry ====
During Rounds' administration, the state offered green cards to foreign investors in exchange for investments in a new South Dakota beef packing plant and other economic investments through the EB-5 visa program established by the federal government in 1990. After the beef packing plant went bankrupt, questions emerged regarding the nature of the investments and the foreign investors. Some investors received neither their EB-5 visas nor the money back from their failed investments, with no indication as to where their money went.
State officials misused funds to pay for their salaries, did not disclose that they owned companies which they gave contracts to, directed money towards companies that went bankrupt and arranged for loans from unknown sources from shell companies located in tax havens. In October 2014, Rounds admitted that he had approved a $1 million state loan to beef packing plant Northern Beef shortly after learning that Secretary of Tourism and State Development Richard Benda had agreed to join the company, with Benda then getting another $600,000 in state loans that was ultimately used to pay his own salary. Benda committed suicide in October 2013, days before a possible indictment over embezzlement and grand theft charges.

=== 2014 U.S. Senate election ===

Speculation persisted that in 2008, Rounds would seek the United States Senate seat held at the time by Tim Johnson, a Democrat who had served since 1997. However, Rounds did not file to run against Johnson by the deadline, passing on the Senate race.
Rounds launched a Senate campaign for 2014 on November 29, 2012 for the seat being vacated by Johnson's retirement. Rounds won the June 2014 Republican primary, defeating four other candidates. Early polls showed Rounds leading by a 2-1 margin against Democratic opponent Rick Weiland. However, polls in October showed a closer three-way race between Rounds, Weiland, and independent former Senator Larry Pressler. Independent conservative former state legislator Gordon Howie was also in the race.
Rounds ultimately won the four-way Senate race of 2014 with a majority of the votes cast. The results were as follows:
Republican: Mike Rounds – 50.37%
Democrat: Rick Weiland – 29.51%
Independent: Larry Pressler – 17.09%
Independent: Gordon Howie – 3.03%

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Make voter registration easier **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support ** means you believe: 
  * Voter ID laws are racist and intended to suppress minority voting. 
  * More enforcement of right to vote, not enforcement against voters. 
  * Public funds should be used for political campaigns. 
  * The best way to reduce the influence of big-money lobbyists and special interests is to remove as much money as possible from campaigning. Free television time would be a good start. 
  * **Support** means you believe: 
  * Voter ID laws just make it harder for people to vote, and we should work to make it EASIER to vote. 
  * Reforms are needed in campaign finance, in order to reduce the influence of moneyed interests. 
  * Those reforms might include restrictions on personal donations to political campaigns; restrictions on corporate, labor union, or PAC donations; and restrictions on PAC activities. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: 
  * ID requirements for voting are reasonable. 
  * Politicians will always find loopholes in any campaign finance reform, so the best approach is just to monitor campaigns for lawbreaking and leave the rest to the press. Better reporting of donations would be useful. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: 
  * Voter fraud undermines the most fundamental process of democracy, and we need to fight it. 
  * Campaign donations are free speech, and should not be limited for corporations nor for individuals. PACs and 527 committees should be similarly allowed free speech via unlimited spending on any issue or any candidate they choose. 

This question is looking for your views on whether wealthy individuals should
have an unlimited right to finance political candidates (including
themselves). However you answer the above question would be similar to your
response to these statements:

  * Require TV networks to provide free air time to candidates 
  * Stricter limits on political campaign funds 
  * Voter ID laws are racist 
  * Suppressing the vote is incumbency protection 
  * Overturn _Citizens United_ via a Constitutional Amendment 
  * Include a checkoff box on tax returns for optional $1 contributions 
  * Support "Clean Election" laws where candidates receive funding if they agree to spending limits 
  * Restrict PAC (political action committees) spending on individual campaigns. 
  * Restrict the activities of 527 committees (independent fundraising entities such as MoveOn.org or the Swift Boat Veterans committee) 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of taxpayer funding for political campaigns. 
  * **Support** means you believe that restrictions on campaign finance, and/or partial public funding, is a **practical** means to reduce undue political influence. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe some **practical** reforms are needed, but that the basic system of privately financing political campaigns is acceptable. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that the **principle** of free speech applies to political campaign donations. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

**Campaign Finance Reform**
  * "McCain-Feingold" refers to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as BCRA, named after its sponsors, Sen. John McCain (R, AZ) and Sen. Russ Feingold (D, WI). McCain-Feingold doubled the campaign donation limit from $1,000 per person to $2,000 per person ($2,500 in 2012), known as "hard money." The law banned "soft money" contributions to political parties, but later Supreme Court cases, particularly "Citizens United," allowed unlimited soft money for purposes of advertising for or against a candidate as long as there was no "coordination" with the campaign. 

  * Citizens United refers to a 2010 Supreme Court case which allowed unlimited spending by Super-PACs on behalf of any candidate, as long as the TV ads are not coordinated with the campaign itself. Super-PACs dominate the spending in the 2012 presidential primaries. 

  * PAC money means donations to political action committees, which is used for issue ads which typically favor one candidate, but do not count in federal spending limits. 

  * Soft money means donations to the national party rather than to a particular candidate ($193 million in the 1998 election, for example). 

  * Hard money is subject to less reform proposals -- it means cash donations to a particular candidate, which must be fully reported to the FEC. 

  * Individuals may donate a maximum of $1000 to one candidate, but may donate any amount of soft money, and any amount to PACs. 

  * Candidates who volutarily limit their campaign spending qualify for federal matching funds of about $100 million. 

**Earmarks**
  * Earmark Reform" refers to changing the rules of Congress to restrict earmarks," which are currently legal and ethical. 

  * Earmarks" means line items in legislative bills which allocate specific monetary resources to a specific purpose (or to a specific company). 

  * An example is a highway improvement project in a House member's district, buried in a 1,000-page spending bill. 

  * Earmarks have become controversial because, in theory, members of Congress could quietly allocate an earmark that would benefit a campaign donor (known as pork-barrel spending"). 

  * Proposed reforms range from full disclosure (showing every earmark and its originating legislator on a public website) to the Line Item Veto (allowing the President to veto earmarks without vetoing the entire spending bill). 

**Czars**
  * The term "czar" refers to a powerful presidential appointee who is not confirmed by the Senate. In other words, a "czar" is answerable only to the President, unlike normal Cabinet secretaries and other appointees, who must pass the Senate confirmation process. 

  * "Czar" is an informal title used by the press and sometimes by the appointee. For example, [Elizabeth Warren](../Senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm) was known as the "Consumer Czar," but her formal title was "Special Advisor for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau." 

  * Czars were popularized by Pres. Clinton and the czar count increased to several dozen under Pres. George W. Bush and Pres. Obama, but the practice goes back to the 1930s. 

**Term Limits**
  * The Constitution limits the president to two terms, or a total of 10 years. There are not limits for the US House or the US Senate. 

  * In March 1998, the Supreme Court let stand term limits for state lawmakers, but previously ruled that establishing such restrictions nationally would require amending the Constitution. Efforts to limit federal Congressional terms died out in early 1997. 

  * 18 states have laws limiting politicians' terms, and in 1998, more than 200 state legislators were forced to retire. 

  * The latest push is for term limits for judges. The purpose would be to limit Judicial activism, which means establishing new laws from the bench rather than from Congress. 

**Balanced Budget Amendment**
  * In 1998, the Senate defeated by one vote a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the Constitution. It would have mandated an end to deficit spending unless 60% of Congress voted to override. 
  * State budget balancing requirements typically only apply to the _operating budget_ (ongoing expenses), but not to _capital expenditures_ (one-time investments). The proposed BBA restricts both. 
  * The Line Item Veto would be another Constitutional Amendment intended to reduce budget growth, by allowing the President to selectively veto particular spending items. 
  * Corporate welfare restrictions are often addressed in the context of a BBA or Line Item Veto. However, most federal corporate subsidies are embedded in the tax code rather than in the spending side of the budget. 

**Devolution to States**
  * Unfunded Mandates mean that the federal government requires states to undertake activities without providing funding for them. 
  * Block Grants mean that the federal government gives states funds to spend as each state sees fit. 
  * Devolution means the federal government should close departments and agencies, transfer functions to the states, or otherwise yield control over policy which is now federally controlled. The philosophy behind devolving power to the states is based in the 10th Amendment. It is currently appiled primarily to welfare reform. 

**Reinventing Government**
  * Reinvention has been the official policy of the federal government since 1993. The basic concepts are: 
  * Government should steer rather than row (provide a framework for non-government action rather than operate institutions). 
  * Government should focus on outcomes (desired results) and needs of customers (service recipients), rather than inputs (dollars and jobs) and needs of bureaucracies (rules). 
  * Government should decentralize and address problems from the lowest level of government possible; 
  * Public agencies should compete with private agencies, and should adopt a market orientation; 
  * Government which work betters also costs less. 

**Election Reform**
  * The GOP proposed a plan in May 2000, that small states would have primaries first, progressing to larger states over a four-month primary season. 
  * An older proposal is a system of regional primaries with a rotating right to go first. 
  * A constitutional amendment would be required to modify the Electoral College, but not to modify the primaries; many states in 2012 switched their GOP primaries from ['Winner-take-all' to 'Proportional'](../2012_WTA_vs_Proportional.htm).  

**Amendment X to the US Constitution** The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. (1791)
