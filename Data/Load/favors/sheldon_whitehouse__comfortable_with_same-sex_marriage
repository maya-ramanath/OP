Sheldon Whitehouse (born October 20, 1955) is an American politician and the junior United States Senator from Rhode Island, serving since 2007. He is a member of the Democratic Party and previously served as a United States Attorney from 1993 to 1998 and as the Attorney General of Rhode Island from 1999 to 2003.


== Early life, education, and pre-political career ==
Whitehouse was born in New York City, New York, the son of Mary Celine (née Rand) and career diplomat Charles Sheldon Whitehouse, and grandson of diplomat Sheldon Whitehouse. He graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and from Yale University in 1978. He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1982.
Whitehouse worked as a clerk for Judge Richard F. Neely of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia from 1982 to 1983. He also worked in the Rhode Island Attorney General's office as a special assistant attorney general from 1985 to 1990, chief of the Regulatory Unit (which oversaw utilities) from 1988 to 1990, and also an assistant attorney general from 1989 to 1990.
Whitehouse worked as Rhode Island Governor Bruce Sundlun's Executive Counsel beginning in 1991, and was later tapped to serve as Director of Policy. He oversaw the state's response to the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC) banking crisis, which took place right after Sundlun took office. Whitehouse was appointed by Sundlun to be the state's Director of Business Regulation in 1992, where he oversaw a drastic reform in the state's workers' compensation insurance system.


== Early political career ==


=== U.S. Attorney ===
President Bill Clinton appointed Whitehouse United States Attorney for Rhode Island in 1994. Whitehouse held the position for four years, and was the first prosecutor to convict a member of organized crime under Clinton's "three strikes law". Whitehouse also initiated the investigation into municipal corruption in Rhode Island that led to Operation Plunder Dome, in which Mayor of Providence Vincent "Buddy" Cianci was eventually convicted on conspiracy charges. As US Attorney for Rhode Island, Whitehouse oversaw an increase in environmental protection efforts, including an investigation into a Narragansett Bay oil spill that yielded the largest fine in state history.


=== State Attorney General ===
In 1998, Whitehouse was elected Rhode Island Attorney General. He initiated a lawsuit against the lead paint industry that ended in a mistrial; the state later won a second lawsuit against former lead paint manufacturers Sherwin Williams Co., Millennium Holdings, and NL Industries that found them responsible for creating a public nuisance. This decision, however, was unanimously overturned by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on July 1, 2008. The Court found that under Rhode Island law it is the responsibility of property owners to abate and mitigate lead hazards.
Whitehouse also founded the Rhode Island Quality Institute, "an organization dedicated to improving health care quality in the State of Rhode Island". He also authorized the first Rhode Island State Police wiretap to investigate public corruption.
Whitehouse's tenure as attorney general also saw some controversy. When black Providence police officer Cornel Young Jr. was shot and killed by two fellow officers while he was off-duty in January 2000, Whitehouse was criticized for not appointing an independent prosecutor to investigate the shooting. Later that year, Whitehouse was criticized when 15-year-old Jennifer Rivera, a witness in a murder case, was shot by a relative of the man she was to testify against later that year. After Rivera's shooting, Whitehouse strengthened the state's witness protection program.


=== 2002 gubernatorial election ===
Whitehouse was defeated in the Democratic primary by former State Senator and three-time failed gubernatorial candidate Myrth York, who was unsuccessful in the general election against Republican Donald Carcieri.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== Elections ===
2006

In 2006, Whitehouse ran for the seat occupied by Senator Lincoln Chafee, a Republican seeking a second full term. After winning the Democratic primary by a large margin, Whitehouse went on to defeat Chafee with 53 percent of the vote.
2012

On November 6, 2012, Sheldon Whitehouse won reelection to a second term in office, easily defeating GOP challenger Barry Hinckley, "both in state results and in local towns. Whitehouse won by 30 points, with 64.9 percent of the vote in Rhode Island".


=== Tenure ===
Whitehouse voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Budget Control Act. He voted against Cut, Cap and Balance and the debt ceiling increase. Earlier in his first term, he voted for the Stimulus package and the TARP. He voted against cap and trade, but sponsored Offshoring Prevention and supported the Global Warming Reduction Act. 
In traditionally liberal Rhode Island, both the Democratic Whitehouse and his predecessor, Republican Lincoln Chafee, hold liberal political positions. But Whitehouse has been to the left of Chafee on economic issues, a position that separated him from his opponent in the last election. In 2007, Whitehouse was ranked the second-most liberal senator by the National Journal.
Whitehouse supports stem cell research, abortion rights, LGBT rights and gay marriage, as well as affirmative action. He has publicly supported a reintroduction of the Equal Rights Amendment. Like Chafee, Whitehouse opposed intervention in Iraq (Chafee was the only Republican senator to vote against it).
He voted to confirm Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, but opposed the nomination of Samuel Alito.
Whitehouse supports a more progressive tax system and strongly opposed the Bush tax cuts and proposals to repeal the Estate Tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He is in favor of gun control and has spoken out against the Patriot Act. Whitehouse supported introducing a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, stating that the United States must use caution in the future and avoid engaging in military action in Iran.
Despite a generally pro-rehabilitation stance on crime, Whitehouse supports the federal use of the death penalty, but opposes its use at the state level in Rhode Island. Whitehouse also opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and other similar proposals. He has styled himself as a supporter of fair trade and is opposed to using presidential authority to "fast-track" normalized trade relations.
In addition, Whitehouse has stated that he does not want torture abuse by the Bush administration to be "papered over", and supports a commission to uncover its war crimes.
Whitehouse has faced some criticism for alleged insider trading, avoiding big losses by trading stocks after top federal officials warned congressional leaders of "the coming economic cataclysm" in September 2008.
PolitiFact determined that Whitehouse falsely claimed Paul Ryan's 2012 budget blueprint "gets rid of Medicare in 10 years." Whitehouse claimed to have meant that Ryan's plan would have ended Medicare "as we know it", turning it into a voucher program.


==== Health care ====
During the passing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Whitehouse cautioned that conservative opposition to the bill was moving toward historical incidences of mob violence, saying, "Too many colleagues are embarked on a desperate, no-holds-barred mission of propaganda, obstruction and fear...cautions us of the excesses to which these malignant, vindictive passions can ultimately lead. Tumbrils have rolled through taunting crowds. Broken glass has sparkled in darkened streets. Strange fruit has hung from southern trees".
In December 2009, Whitehouse said "birthers", "fanatics", and "people running around in right-wing militia and Aryan support groups" oppose Obamacare.


==== Environmental issues ====
In November 2011, ThinkProgress reported Whitehouse's introduction of a bill that would require federal natural resource agencies to be concerned with the long-term effects of climate change, and to encourage preparation of natural resource adaptation plans by the states. The Safeguarding America’s Future and Environment Act (SAFE) Act also "would create a science advisory board to ensure that the planning uses the best available science”.
In reference to the proposed action on mandatory emissions curbs, Whitehouse told The Hill that "I am not hearing anybody on our side, even the people who are more economically concerned about the climate legislation who come from coal states, that sort of thing, saying, 'What are we going to say about this, is this a problem?'"
Whitehouse dismissed Climategate: “Climategate should properly be known as Climategate-gate because it was the scandal that was phony.”
In May 2011 Whitehouse introduced legislation to support coastal jobs and protect oceans. The National Endowment for the Oceans, Coasts, and Great Lakes Act (S.973) is pending.
Environmental Defense Fund praised him for working to protect the Gulf Coast wetlands.
Whitehouse has said that development of alternate energy sources, including solar power, will eliminate U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He has cited the installation of new solar panels on three new bank branches in Rhode Island, saying that the projects “created jobs, they put people to work, they lowered the cost for these banks of their electrical energy, and they get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply”. In regard to these comments, PolitiFact investigated the economics of renewable energy and determined that solar and wind investments would not have a large effect on oil consumption, calling Whitehouse's comments "mostly false" due to "this misimpression—and because of the other inaccuracies in Whitehouse’s speech".
On November 14, 2013, Whitehouse gave his 50th weekly Senate speech on climate change. The series of speeches highlights the science of climate change and offers paths for the United States to take strong action.
In a May 29, 2015, Washington Post editorial, Whitehouse advocated prosecution of members of the fossil fuel industry under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), in order to investigate their interest in anti-global-warming advocacy.


==== U.S. Attorney controversy ====

Whitehouse received notice in a June 2007 opinion piece from Los Angeles Times journalist and senior editorial writer Michael McGough for Whitehouse's careful questioning and thoughtful statements, and his understanding that the less said, the more effective his efforts may be. McGough cited this statement by Whitehouse about President George W. Bush's "crony" (McGough's word) Attorney General Alberto Gonzales: "[Gonzales's] stated definition of what is improper for him and his staff, believe it or not, tracks the legal standard for criminal obstruction of justice. Is that the kind of attorney general we want?"
In the spring of 2007, Whitehouse joined other Senators in pressuring for Gonzales's resignation. After Gonzales's first appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee related to the controversy, Whitehouse told NPR, "[Gonzales] had a hard sell to make to me, and he didn't make it." He continued to question Gonzales's service in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.


=== Committee assignments ===
Whitehouse is a member of the following committees:
Committee on the Budget
Committee on Environment and Public Works
Subcommittee on Oversight
Subcommittee on Superfund, Toxics and Environmental Health
Subcommittee on Water and Wildlife (Ranking Member)

Committee on the Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism (Ranking Member)
Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law

Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee
Special Committee on Aging
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe
International Narcotics Control Caucus
Impeachment Trial Committee on the Articles against Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. 
On August 3, 2007, it was announced that Whitehouse would receive the Golden Gavel award, having presided over Senate debates for more than 100 hours in his first six months in office.


=== Caucus memberships ===
Healthy Kids Caucus
International Conservation Caucus (Co-Chair)
International Narcotics Control Caucus
Senate Oceans Caucus (Co-Chair)


== Electoral history ==


== United States Attorney General and U.S. Supreme Court speculation ==
Upon Attorney General Eric Holder's announcement in September 2014 of his intention to step down, some speculated that Whitehouse could be nominated as Holder's replacement.
In February 2016, after the death of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, USA Today named Whitehouse as a possible nominee to fill the vacancy. Whitehouse's service as a U.S. Attorney and as Attorney General of Rhode Island gives him both legislative experience and experience as a legal official, though not as a judge.


== Personal life ==
In 1986 Whitehouse married Sandra Thornton, a marine biologist and granddaughter of James Worth Thornton and Elena Mumm Thornton Wilson. Her step-grandfather was prominent essayist and critic Edmund Wilson. They live in Rhode Island with their two children, Molly Whitehouse and Alexander "Xander" Whitehouse.
Whitehouse is a descendent of William Bradford, colonial governor of Massachusetts, as well as theologian Archibald Alexander, Episcopal bishop Henry John Whitehouse, and railroad executive Charles Crocker.
After meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in September 2008, Whitehouse came under scrutiny due to possible insider trading, when he sold a number of positions, valued at least at $250,000, over the next six days. Whitehouse was trading anywhere from 5–20% of his net worth. In Senate candidate Barry Hinckley's book, he said that it was "implausible that much of someone’s net worth would be traded without someone’s knowledge". A spokesperson for Whitehouse's office explained that the senator "is not actively involved in the management" of the accounts implicated, and that he "neither directed his financial advisor to undertake any transaction during that time, nor ever took advantage of any exclusive or secret information".

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Comfortable with same-sex marriage **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: Neither governments nor corporations have any right to decide about sexual preferences. Give same-sex partners the same status as heterosexual partners, and give same-sex marriages the same status as traditional marriage. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Homosexuals should be treated with equal respect as other members of society, not treated as criminals. You acknowledge the diversity of our society by including same-sex partners in most or all benefits of heterosexual marriage partners, but civil unions are preferable to using the term 'marriage.' 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Homosexuality is a lifestyle _choice_, and therefore those who choose it should live by the consequences of their choice. Marriage between a man and a woman is the central institution of American society - we shouldn't do anything that perverts that concept or threatens that ideal. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Homosexuality is immoral. You believe that the 'Gay Agenda' seeks to normalize homosexual activity and make it part of the mainstream as 'just another lifestyle.' We must draw the line so that homosexual values are not imposed upon our children. 

This question is looking for your views on gay rights. However you answer the
above question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Allow gay marriage
  * Allow gays to serve openly in the military
  * More support for AIDS research
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of gay equality. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** improvements in civil rights for gays. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe that society needs **practical** restrictions on gay rights to foster family development. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the biblical **principle** of restricting homosexual activity.

****BACKGROUND**

### Gay Rights

**_LGBT**_

  * "GLBT" refers to gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender rights. At the core of the "T" component is what pro-gay activists is a person's "gender identity," which means that a person defines their own gender rather than their biology at birth. Using the term GLBT implies support for expanding gay rights to transgendered individuals, who are currently not covered by most laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination. In 32 states, there is no protection from being fired for simply being transgendered. **_Don't-Ask-Don't-Tell**_

  * The Clinton administration in 1993 enacted a dont ask/dont tell (DADT) policy for gays in the military. Under the DADT rules, gays could be discharged from the military for homosexual contact and for stating their sexual orientation, but the military is not allowed to ask them their orientation. 

  * The DADT policy was repealed in 2010; since then, gays may serve openly in the military. Hence gay and lesbian people may now openly serve in the US military. Since 1993, the DADT policy held that homosexuals may serve as long as they do not announce their homosexuality ("Don't Tell"), but also that the military may not investigate their homosexuality ("Don't Ask"). 

  * The policy banning open homosexuals serving in the military was repealed on Sept. 20, 2011. Hence gay and lesbian people may now openly serve in the US military.  
  
  
**_Family and Relationships**_

* **Adoption:** 19 states allow gay and lesbian couples to adopt children in a complex and expensive two-step process, in which one parent first adopts and then the second can petition for joint rights. 

* **Ceremonial Marriages:** Same Sex Marriages may be officiated by church officials, or anyone else, but ceremonial marriages in and of themselves involve no civil laws and carry no legal benefits or responsibilities. 

* **Domestic Partnership Registration:** is a means by which some cities allow opposite- and same-sex couples to go on public record as a non-married couple. The major benefit is used to establish legal responsibility for debts after a relationship ends. 

* **Domestic Partnership Affidavit:** Many private employers and municipalities offer domestic partner benefits to their workers, based on signing a legal affidavit that defines an economic relationship.    
  
**_Civil Unions**_

* In Dec. 1999, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed a 1996 ruling, and defined marriage as between different sex couples. 

* In April 2000, the Vermont House of Representatives gave final approval to same-sex marriages. Gays and lesbians may join in "civil unions," which are no expected to be recognized by other states and will not entitle the partners to federal benefits. The Vermont Supreme Court had ruled in December that gay and lesbian couples denied the right to marry were suffering from unconstitutional discrimination. 

* In June 2000, the Supreme Court let stand a New Jersey ruling that allowed the Boy Scouts to ban gay scoutmasters. 

* In July 2000, Vermont began offering a separate form of marriage, conferring about 300 spousal rights to same sex couples. 

* The Civil Union license is obtained from town clerks. There is a $20 fee. The Unions are "certified" either by justices of the peace, judge, or willing member of the clergy. Civil Union couples also have the right to dissolve their unions through a "dissolution" process in Family Court.   
  
**_Civil Unions Benefits**_

* **Definitions:** Use of State laws that confer benefits or rights to people based on their marital or family status, such as family landowner rights to hunt and fish, or definitions of family farmers. 

* **Adoption:** Entitled to all the protections and benefits available when adopting. Same-sex couples already are allowed to adopt, but laws would reflect that those couples would now be treated as spouses. 

* **Compensation:** Use of victims' compensation and workers' compensation related to spouses. 

* **Discrimination:** Use of laws prohibiting discrimination based on marital status. 

* **Health Care:** Able to make medical decisions for incapacitated partner. Able to visit hospitals visitation and be notified of a partner's condition. 

* **Insurance:** State employees are treated as spouses for insurance or continuing care contracts. 

* **Lawsuits:** Able to sue for wrongful death, the emotional distress caused by a partner's death or injury, and loss of consortium caused by death or injury. 

* **Property:** Entitled to joint title, transfer from one to the other on death, and property transfer tax benefits. 

* **Probate:** Use probate law and procedures. 

* **State Tax:** Treated as an economic unit. 

* **Testimony:** Not be compelled to testify against one another.   
  
**_Federal rights NOT Covered by Civil Unions**_

* **Immigration Rights:** Cannot have a non-U.S. spouse become a full citizen. 

* **Social Security:** Cannot collect benefits upon death of a spouse. 

* **Federal Taxes:** Cannot file jointly as a married couple   
  
**_Same-sex Marriage**_

* **Goodridge v. Department of Public Health:** The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in Nov. 2003 that cities must issue same-sex marriage licenses. The first such license was issues in Cambridge Massachusetts on May 17, 2004. 

* **1913 Law:** A Massachusetts law from 1913, targeting miscegeny or mixed-race marriage, required that residents of other states be legally marriageable in their home state, in order to qualify in Massachusetts. This law has prevented same-sex couples from elsewhere marrying in Massachusetts. In Feb. 2007, Rhode Island became the first state to accept same-sex marriage licenses from Massachusetts (despite that same-sex couples cannot marry in Rhode Island itself). 

* **California**'s Supreme Court enabled same-sex marriage in a ruling on May 15, 2008, overturning a statewide ban, citing a 1948 reversal of a ban on interracial marriages (but later overturned the law). 

* **Connecticut**'s Supreme Court enabled same-sex marriage in a ruling on Oct. 10, 2008, replacing CT's civil union law. 

* **State DOMA:** Largely as a result of the Massachusetts law, 29 states banned same-sex marriage. The laws are known as 'Defense of Marriage Amendments'. Several 2004 & 2008 ballot initiatives brought out enough voters to not only pass state DOMA laws, but to influence the Congressional and/or presidential election. The issue retains high interest in the 2012 presidential race. 

* **Federal DOMA:** refers to the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress in 1996, which defined marriage as consisting of one man and one woman (in other words, barring same-sex marriage). DOMA applies to all federal benefits and taxes, but not necessarily to state benefits and taxes. 

* In May 2012, a federal appeals court in Boston ruled that DOMA unconstitutionally denies benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. The ruling supports the Obama administration's 2011 announcement that it considered the law unconstitutional and no longer would defend it. 

* On March 27, 2013, the Supreme Court heard _US v. Windsor_ on overturning DOMA, and on June 26, 2013, overturned key components of DOMA as unconstitutional. DOMA was declared to violate the equal protection clause, and establishes that same-sex married couples are entitled to equal federal benefits as all married couples. 

* **Domestic Partnership:** 11 states have some sort of civil union or domestic partnership law for same-sex couples. 

* As of the 2012 election, 11 states --CA, CO, HI, ME, MD, NV, OR, RI, WI, IL, and WA -- have domestic partnership laws. 

* As of the 2012 election, 1 state -- NJ -- has a civil union law. 

* As of the 2012 election, 3 states -- MA, CA, and CT -- have same-sex marriage laws. 

* As of the 2012 election,13 states allowed same-sex civil unions or had some similar legislation, and 29 states had laws defining marriage as one-man-one-woman. By the 2014 election, the number of states allowing same-sex marriage had risen to 34 states. Several more states have legalized same-sex marriage but it has not yet taken effect (but will by the 2016 election). With a majority of states having legalized same-sex marriage, at issue now is federal law, which includes numerous aspects of federal benefits. 

  
  
**_Societal Issues**_

* **Boy Scouts:** In June 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts of America can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders. 

* **Don't Ask, Don't Tell:** The Clinton administration in 1993 enacted a "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Under the existing rules, gays can be discharged from the military for homosexual contact and for stating their sexual orientation, but the military is not allowed to ask them their orientation.
