Joni Kay Ernst (née Culver; July 1, 1970) is an American politician who is the junior United States Senator from Iowa, elected in the November 2014 election, defeating Democrat Bruce Braley. She previously served as a Republican member of the Iowa Senate from 2011 to 2014 and was also a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard prior to retiring from the military in 2015. Ernst is the first woman to represent Iowa in the United States Congress and the first female veteran—from any state—to serve in the U.S. Senate.


== Early life and career ==
Ernst was born Joni Kay Culver in Montgomery County, Iowa, the daughter of Marilyn and Richard Culver. She was valedictorian of her class at Stanton High School. Ernst earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Iowa State University, and a Master of Public Administration degree from Columbus College. While in college, Ernst took part in an agricultural exchange to the Soviet Union.


=== Military career ===
Ernst served as a lieutenant colonel in the logistics branch, commanding the 185th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Camp Dodge, the largest battalion in the Iowa Army National Guard. Upon her retirement from the military in 2015, Ernst had served 23 years between the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard. She spent 14 months in Kuwait in 2003–04 as a company commander during the Iraq War. Her unit was ordered into active Federal service on December 7, 2003, at Johnston, Iowa and was released from active Federal service on June 3, 2005, receiving the Meritorious Unit Commendation (Army) with streamer embroidered Southwest Asia 2004-2005. It participated in the War on Terrorism in Iraq, Transition of Iraq, and Iraqi Governance.


=== Iowa State Senate ===
Ernst was elected the Montgomery County Auditor in 2004 and re-elected in 2008.
Ernst was elected to the Iowa State Senate in a special election in 2011 and re-elected in 2012. She represented District 12, which serves the southwest part of the state. Ernst was a member of the Education, Appropriations, Veterans Affairs, Rules and Administration and Health and Human Services committees of the Iowa State Senate committees.
Following her election to the U.S. Senate, she resigned from the Iowa State Senate effective November 28, 2014.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== 2014 U.S. Senate election ===

In July 2013, Ernst announced that she would seek the Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Senator Tom Harkin.
Ernst received the endorsement of Iowa Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds in October 2013. She was also endorsed by 23 current and former state legislators. In March the Ernst campaign was endorsed by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. In May 2014, she was endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Ernst received widespread attention for a campaign advertisement she released in March 2014 where she employed a tongue-in-cheek comparison between her experience castrating pigs and her ability to cut "pork" in Congress. Many found the ad to be humorous and it was spoofed by late-night comedians including Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert, Before the ad aired, Ernst had struggled in fundraising, and two polls of the Republican primary taken in February 2014 had shown her in second place, several points behind opponent Mark Jacobs. After it aired, a Suffolk University poll in early April showed her with a narrow lead and a Loras College poll showed her essentially tied with Jacobs. By May, she was being described by the media as the "strong front-runner".
In an interview with the Des Moines Register on May 9, 2014, Ernst said she was "extremely offended" by comments made by Republican opponent Mark Jacobs in which she was characterized as AWOL due to missing over 100 votes in the legislative session ending April 7, 2014. Ernst stated: "If [Mark Jacobs] had any sort of service like I have, he would've understood what AWOL means. I have not been AWOL, I will never be AWOL." Previously, in an article in The Gazette, Ernst cited her National Guard duty to rebuff criticism about her missing votes, but The Gazette found that only 12 of the 117 missed votes came on days when she was on duty. The other 105 missed votes represented 57 percent of the Iowa Senate votes that session. Ernst's spokesman said that she has had a better than 90 percent voting record during her career in the Senate and that she never claimed guard service was the only reason she's missed votes this session.
In endorsing her for the Republican Primary nomination, the Des Moines Register stated: "Ernst is a smart, well-prepared candidate who can wrestle with the details of public policy from a conservative perspective without seeming inflexible." On October 23, Ernst cancelled a scheduled meeting with the Des Moines Register's editorial board, citing as a reason the newspaper's negative editorials about her. The newspaper's editorial board endorsed Ernst's opponent, Democrat Bruce Braley.
On June 16, 2014, in an event organized by Americans for Prosperity, at a panel titled "The Senate: A Window of Policy Opportunity for Principled Leaders", Ernst thanked the group for its fundraising. In July 2014, Ernst's campaigning was temporarily paused while she participated in two weeks of National Guard duty. In that same month, Ernst delivered the Republican Party's weekly address, where she criticized the health care scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs and pushed for a balanced federal budget and entitlement reform.
On August 29, Ernst and Braley announced their agreement to hold three televised debates in Davenport, Des Moines, and Sioux City. They were held on September 28, October 11 and 16, respectively.
Ernst won the 2014 Senate race 52.2% to 43.7%. She is the first woman elected to represent Iowa in either house of Congress.

=== Tenure ===
Ernst was sworn into the United States Senate on January 3, 2015. She delivered the official Republican response to the State of the Union a week later on January 20.


== Political positions ==


=== Constitutional and federal issues ===

Ernst has proposed eliminating the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Education, and the Environmental Protection Agency as a means of cutting federal spending. She has advocated eliminating the Department of Education "not just because it would save taxpayer dollars, but because I do believe our children are better educated when it's coming from the state."
Ernst has expressed her support for allowing law-abiding citizens to "freely carry" weapons but abide by rules against carrying in public buildings like schools. In February 2013, Ernst co-sponsored a resolution addressing "the Iowa General Assembly's refusal to recognize or support any statutes, presidential directives, or other regulations and proclamations which conflict with the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and which are expressly preempted by the rulings of the United States Supreme Court”. She has also received an "A" rating from the National Rifle Association for her support of gun-rights issues.
As an Iowa state senator, Ernst co-sponsored resolutions concerning state nullification of federal law. One such bill asserted that Iowa could ignore any federal laws which "are directly in violation of the Tenth Amendment," while another "urg[ed] the nullification" of certain EPA regulations related to coal-fired electricity plants. In a September 2013 forum held by the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition, Ernst said Congress shouldn't bother to pass laws "that the states would consider nullifying", referring to what she describes as "200-plus years of federal legislators going against the Tenth Amendment's states' rights." Courts have consistently ruled that nullification is unconstitutional. During the 2014 Senatorial general election, Ernst's supporters argued that she did not support nullification, and that "her comments on it were about encouraging Iowans to send her to Washington to pass good laws."
When asked at a Montgomery County, Iowa candidate forum in January 2014, about the Supreme Court case about the constitutionality of President Barack Obama's recess appointments, she said that Obama had "become a dictator", and that if he acted unconstitutionally, he should face the proper repercussions as determined by Congress, "whether that's removal from office, whether that's impeachment." When the tape of that event was published in August 2014 by Yahoo News, her spokeswoman said that "If any president oversteps their bounds, there are procedures in place for Congress and the American people to hold him or her accountable. Impeachment is a strong word and should not be thrown around lightly.”


=== Economic issues ===
Ernst opposes the federal minimum wage, and instead argues that states should have sole authority to set their own minimum wages. In an August 2014 interview with the Mason City Globe-Gazette, Ernst stated: "For the federal government to set the minimum wage for all 50 states is ridiculous." She has pointed to differences in the cost of living in various states, and has said: "I think $7.25 is appropriate for Iowa, but that's up for our state legislators to decide, and I'm willing to have those discussions at the state level." In response to a report by the Congressional Budget Office report which projected that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would cost 500,000 jobs, but would lift 900,000 people out of poverty, Ernst stated that "government and government-mandated wage increases are not the solution—especially when doing so comes at the expense of the jobs of hard working Americans."
During the 2013 legislative session, Ernst worked on legislation which reduced property taxes in Iowa. She supports a "fairer, flatter, and simpler" federal tax code.
In a May 2014 interview with The Des Moines Register, Ernst expressed her support for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget, as well as a reduction in spending on entitlement programs and discretionary spending. She has also expressed support for a partial privatization of Social Security accounts for young workers while protecting Social Security for seniors and those nearing retirement.


=== Environmental issues ===
On the subject of global warming, Ernst has stated: "I don’t know the science behind climate change, I can't say one way or another what is the direct impact from whether it's manmade or not", and believes that any regulatory role by the government to address it needs to be "very small". Ernst has proposed eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency and criticized its interpretation of the Clean Water Act as applied to farms. In a Republican primary debate in May 2014, Ernst said she would have voted against the 2014 U.S. Farm Bill and stated her view that the Clean Water Act is damaging for business. Ernst has expressed her opposition to cap-and-trade.
At a January 2014 GOP forum in Montgomery County, Iowa, Ernst warned that Agenda 21, a 1992 United Nations voluntary action plan for sustainable development, could force Iowa farmers off their land, dictate what cities Iowans must live in, and control how Iowa citizens travel from place to place. During the general-election campaign, Ernst moderated her tone, saying: "I don’t think that the U.N. Agenda 21 is a threat to Iowa farmers... I think there are a lot of people that follow that issue in Iowa. It may be something that is very important to them, but I think Iowans are very smart and that we have a great legislature here, we have a very intelligent governor, and I think that we will protect Iowans."


=== Foreign policy ===

Regarding the Iraq War and weapons of mass destruction, Ernst stated: "We don't know that there were weapons on the ground when we went in, however, I do have reason to believe there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. That was the intelligence that was operated on. I have reason to believe there was weapons of mass destruction. My husband served in Saudi Arabia as an Army Central Command sergeant major for a year and that's a hot-button topic in that area." After criticism from Iowa Democrats and some commentators, Ernst then issued a clarifying statement in which she stated that she did not mean to suggest that Iraq had WMD at the time of invasion, but rather that Iraq had had WMDs in their past which they used, and that her point was that "we don't know exactly what happened to those weapons".
When asked whether she supports the limited airstrikes conducted in Iraq in August 2014, Ernst said: "What I can say is what I would have supported is leaving additional troops in Iraq longer and perhaps we wouldn't have this situation today".
In an interview with Time Magazine, Ernst said that she was sexually harassed in the military, stating that “I had comments, passes, things like that” which she was able to stop, and said she will support removing sexual assault cases from the chain of command.


=== Healthcare issues ===
Ernst indirectly endorsed Paul Ryan’s partially privatized Medicare model in a 2011 Iowa Senate vote. According to an August 2014 article in The Gazette, she has not laid out a detailed plan for Medicare reform.
Ernst supports replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act saying that it is "an additional tax of $1.2 trillion on the American people over the next decade and I believe we need to eliminate Obamacare but replace it with free market alternatives."
In answering a survey for the Campaign for Liberty in 2012, Ernst answered "Yes" when asked if she would support legislation that would "nullify ObamaCare and authorize state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement [it]."


=== Social issues ===
Ernst has said she believes marriage is a "state issue". She co-sponsored a failed bill to amend the Iowa constitution to have marriage legally defined as between one man and one woman. She opposes same-sex marriage.
Ernst is pro-life, believing that life begins at conception. She voted for a fetal personhood amendment in the Iowa Senate in 2013 and has said that she would support a federal personhood bill.
In 2013, Ernst voted against bringing Senate File 79 up for a vote in the Iowa Senate, a bill that would legalize medical marijuana. Ernst expressed concerns that the drug "would ultimately end up in the hands of minors".


== Roast and Ride event ==
While not a political candidate for the 2016 U.S. presidential election, on June 6, 2015, Ernst sponsored "Joni's 1st Annual Roast and Ride," an event which featured a motorcycle parade in which she rode a motorcycle. Ernst invited Republican presidential candidates to attend the event. According to coverage by the Des Moines Register, "Speaking to the media, Ernst indicated that it is critical for presidential candidates to engage in the type of retail politicking this and other Iowa events provide." Ernst said that "Iowans want to see their candidates. They want to reach out and shake their hands. They want to ask that question face to face. Grass roots is important. Family is important. Neighbors are important in Iowa. And they want someone that fits that mold and is able to connect with voters. Every candidate is going to have their reasons whether they participate or not," but they will get a better response if they do come to the Iowa Straw Poll."  The event was attended by Republican presidential candidates Carly Fiorina, Lindsey Graham, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, and Scott Walker.


== Speculation about 2016 vice presidential candidacy ==

In May 2016, Ernst was placed on the Washington Post's short list as a possible vice presidential running mate for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign to become the 45th President of the United States. Other media outlets included her as a possible benefit to Trump's campaign as well. In 2015, when she was asked if she would become a nominee for Vice President, she demurred but did not decline. "Well, I think that's—that's nice," she said. "Did my mother pay you to say that?"


== Personal life ==
Ernst resides in Red Oak, Iowa with her husband, Gail, a retired Command Sergeant Major in the United States Army Rangers, and their daughter, Libby. Gail Ernst also has two daughters from a previous marriage.
Ernst is a lifetime member of the Montgomery County Republican Women, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2265, Montgomery County Court of Honor, Altrusa, PEO Chapter HB, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, and member of the Montgomery County Farm Bureau. She is a member of the Mamrelund Lutheran Church (ELCA) of Stanton, Iowa.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Keep God in the public sphere **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: Judeo-Christian values _are_ American values. Belief in God is what America was founded upon, so tax-funding religious organizations, or praying in school, does not violate the separation of church and state. Displaying the Ten Commandments is appropriate because they are the moral basis for Western law. The Pledge of Allegiance should continue to include the phrase "Under God." 
  * **Support** means you believe: We need to teach values in our schools and account for our religious values in providing social services. The more our children are exposed to prayer, the Ten Commandments, and other traditional values, the better off they are. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Faith-based origanizations and prayer in schools are inappropriate because they fail to recognize American pluralism and religious diversity. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Separation of church and state precludes allowing school prayer, or providing funding for religious organizations. It also precludes other aspects of religion in government buildings, such as posting the Ten Commandments in public places. We should not violate the Constitutional principle in this case. 

This question is looking for you views on how religion should play a part in
public institutions.  However you answer the above question would be similar
to your response to these statements:

  * Post the Ten Commandments in public schools 
  * "Separation of church and state" does not mean "keep religion out of schools"
  * "Separation of church and state" does not preclude "faith-based organizations" providing social services 
  * Nativity scenes on City Hall lawns are acceptable 
  * Organized Prayer In Public Schools 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** that religious institutions should be involved in welfare or education. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** reasons that religious institutions are better equipped than government to help with charitable causes and education. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe government oversight is needed for **practical** reasons of effectiveness or full inclusiveness. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of church-state separation precludes the involvement of religious institutions in social services. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

### 2012 Election Welfare Issues

  * **_Faith-Based Welfare**_: President Bush initiated the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships to institute his Charitable Choice proposal. Churches are tax-exempt, and donations to churches and other charities are tax-deductible; Pres. Bush's policy was intended to encourage churches to perform more social services. Proponents focus on removing restrictions on religious organizations' activities, so that churches can bid on government block grants for performing welfare services. Opponents claim that lessens restrictions on separation of church and state. 

  * **_Separation of church and state**_: The US Constitution does not mandate "separation of church and state." That phrase comes from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson while President, in 1802. The Constitution's "Establishment Clause" says that the US will have no state church (known as an "established religion"), which has been interpreted to mean the federal government cannot fund one church over another. 

### Welfare-to-Work

  * The welfare reform bill, signed by President Clinton in 1996, ended the federal entitlement to welfare, imposed strict work requirements on recipients, and set a five-year lifetime limit for aid. 
  * In 1995, 88% of poor children received food stamps. By 1998 the figure had dropped to 70%. 
  * The welfare load currently stands at about 2 million recipients, which has dropped by about 1/3 since the welfare reform bill was enacted.  

### Faith-Based Organizations

  * As welfare decreases, churches and other faith-based organizations (FBOs) pick up the slack. 
  * Churches are tax-exempt, and donations to churches and other charities are tax-deductible, so federal activity focuses on tax reform to encourage donations, by increasing deductibility on federal and state income taxes. 
  * Other recent Congressional bills focus on removing restrictions on religious organizations' activities, so that churches can bid on government block grants for performing welfare services. 
  * The lessening of restrictions on separation of church and state for this purpose is known as Charitable Choice.  

### **_NCLB**_ \- No Child Left Behind

  * NCLB is the 2001 bipartisan law intended to improve K-12 schools, under the theory of **_standards-based education reform**_. 
  * States are required to establish **_standardized testing**_, so that all high school graduates meet the test criteria. 
  * States are also required to give options (school choice) to students who attend schools that fail to meet NCLB's **_Adequate Yearly Progress**_ (AYP). 
  * The controversy over NCLB currently focuses on funding: **_Opponents of NCLB**_ argue that states are provided inadequate federal funding for implementation of NCLB, and that therefore NCLB represents an "unfunded mandate" on states. 
  * **_Proponents of NCLB**_ argue that the law provides accountability for schools; fights against incompetent teachers; and provides alternatives to failing schools. 
  * Progress is measured in the federal [National Assessment of Educational Progress](http://nationsreportcard.gov/) (NAEP), commonly knows as the "Nation's Report Card."  

### Education Buzzwords

  * **_Intelligent Design: **_ refers to species development run by intelligent designer (implying God, without the explicitly religious terminology). In contrast, evolution teaches a random process for natural species development. Critics have called intelligent design a thinly disguised version of creationism, which takes a literal approach to the creation account in Genesis, that the earth was created in six days and is less than 10,000 years old. 

  * **_Social Promotion: **_ Candidates debate whether students should advance a grade merely to keep up with their peer group. 90% of K-12 students are promoted (10% per year are retained). 
  * **_Teacher Pay: **_ K-12 Teachers salaries average $34,200; college instructors average $63,000; compared to $50,700 for similarly educated non-teachers. Public school teachers earn 25% to 100% more than private school teachers. Generally, any reference to increasing teacher pay implies opposition to [vouchers](../Background_Education.htm#School_Choice) while negative references to teachers unions implies support of vouchers. 

  * **_Teacher Testing: **_ Current law is that states certify teachers and decide what their requirements are; there are currently no national standards nor testing. Liberals favor raising teacher pay and oppose teacher testing on the grounds of treating teachers more professionally. 

  * **_Student Testing: **_ Many conservatives advocate for national testing standard or other forms of standards-based education. Generally, any reference to standards, or especially to dealing with failing schools, implies support of [school vouchers.](../Background_Education.htm#School_Choice)

  * **_Smaller Class Size: **_ Many liberals advocate for smaller class sizes, and/or building more schools to achieve them. Generally, any reference to smaller classrooms, or especially to building public schools, implies opposition to [funding private schools.](../Background_School_Choice.htm)

  * **_School Prayer: **_ Current law is that schools allow religious groups to organize on school grounds as if they are any club. Schools are not allowed to conduct prayers at the beginning of school, but neither are they allowed to stop a student from praying. 

  * **_Bilingual Education: **_ Schools may conduct classes in Spanish or other languages using federal Title VII funds, which totaled $380 million last year (1% of total spending). 13% of K-12 students speak a language other than English at home. Generally, liberals favor bilingual education while conservatives favor official English. 

  * **_DOE: **_ The Department of Education spent $38 billion last year (2% of the federal budget). But federal spending only accounts for 9% of education spending; most of the annual $600 billion comes from state & local sources. Hard-core conservatives favor abolishing the Department of Education, which was a Republican Party platform plank in the 1980s. 

  * **_Phonics: **_ Phonics is a method of teaching children to read by sounding out phonemes (groups of letters that represent sounds). Generally, a favorable reference to phonics implies a conservative viewpoint on all the other education issues listed here. 

### School Choice

School Choice generally refers to a school district allowing parents to decide
which school within the district to send their kids to. The political issue is
whether to allow the choice to include private schools, parochial schools, and
home schooling at taxpayer expense. Taxpayer funding of parochial schools
potentially violates the Constitutional separation of church and state.
Taxpayer funding of private schools is controversial because it subsidizes
parents who are currently paying for private schools themselves, and are
usually more wealthy than the average public school family.

### Charter Schools

Charter schools are publicly-funded and publicly-controlled schools which are
privately run. They are usually required to adhere to fewer district rules
than regular public schools.

### Vouchers

Vouchers are a means of implementing school choice -- parents are given a
voucher by the school district, which entitles them to, say, $4,000 applicable
to either public school or private school tuition. The value of the voucher is
generally lower than the cost of one year of public education (which averages
$5,200), so private schools (where tuition averages $8,500) may require cash
payment in addition to the voucher.

### Education Buzzwords

Generally, any reference to standards, or especially to dealing with failing
schools, implies support of school vouchers. Generally, any reference to
smaller classrooms, or especially to building public schools, implies
opposition to funding private schools. Further decoding of education buzzwords
are detailed under [Education](../Background_Education.htm).

### K-12 Education Statistics

  * **_Total spending is $260 billion**_, (7% federal; the rest split state & local) rising by 5% per year. 
  * **_Student population is 50 million**_, rising slowly (1 million per year) since 1984. 
  * **_Public school spending is $5,200 per student**_, staying about even with inflation. 
  * **_Parochial school costs $4,200 per student**_, not discounting church-provided buildings & other subsidies. 
  * **_Private school costs $8,500 per student**_, not discounting scholarships or other financial aid. 
  * **_90% attend public schools**_; about 6 million attend private & parochial schools. 
  * **_78% of schools have Internet access**_; 97% plan to by the year 2000. 
  * **_27% of classrooms have Internet access**_; lower in poor and minority schools. 

### College Education & Cost Statistics

  * 61% of high school graduates continue on to some post-secondary education. 
  * 43% enroll at 4-year colleges; 33% graduate college. 
  * Race strongly determines the percentage enrolling at college   
(49% for Asians; 38% for Blacks; 28% for Hispanics).

  * Socioeconomic status even more strongly determines percentage enrolling at college   
(19% from the poorest of families vs. 70% from the richest of families).

  * Tuition plus room and board at public colleges averages $6,700, and at private college $18,500. 
  * Public college costs 15% of the average familys income, and the percentage is holding steady (tuition rises are keeping pace with median income rises). 
  * Private college costs 42% of the average familys income, and the percentage is also holding steady.
