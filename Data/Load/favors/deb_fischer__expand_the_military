Debra Strobel "Deb" Fischer (born March 1, 1951) is the senior U.S. Senator from the state of Nebraska. Previously, she was a two-term member of the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 43rd District. She defeated former United States Senator Bob Kerrey in the election held on November 6, 2012, and assumed one of Nebraska's two Senate seats in January 2013.
Fischer is a member of the Republican Party.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Fischer was born Debra Strobel in 1951, in Lincoln, Nebraska[1], the daughter of Florence M. (née Bock) and Gerold Carl "Jerry" Strobel[2]. Her father was the State Engineer/Director of the Nebraska Department of Roads under governors Kay Orr and Ben Nelson[3] and her mother was an elementary school teacher with Lincoln Public Schools.
In 1972, she married Bruce Fischer, from Valentine, whom she had met while both attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. She and her husband raised three sons on the Fischer family cattle ranch south of Valentine. In 1988, she returned to the university and completed her B.S. degree in education[4].

=== Elections ===
In 2004, Fischer ran for the Nebraska legislature from the 43rd legislative district. In the nonpartisan primary, she came in second in a field of seven, receiving 2226 votes (25.1%); front-runner Kevin T. Cooksley received 2264 votes (25.5%). In the general election, she defeated Cooksley with 8178 votes to his 8050, for a margin of 50.4%–49.6%.
In 2008, she won re-election unopposed. Nebraska's term-limits law precluded her running for re-election in 2012.


=== Tenure ===
Fischer's district was geographically the largest in the Nebraska Legislature, comprising 12 counties and part of a 13th. During her tenure in the legislature, she did a weekly radio show on seven stations covering her district, and wrote a weekly column printed in several newspapers.
In 2007, she helped to filibuster a bill that created a statewide smoking ban for indoor workplaces and public places.
In 2009, Fischer was one of fourteen co-sponsors of L.B. 675, which required abortion providers to display ultrasound images of the fetus at least one hour prior to the abortions, in a position where the abortion seeker could easily view them. A spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee stated that the Nebraska law was stronger than those of other states, which only required that the client be asked if she wanted to see an ultrasound image. The measure passed by a 40–5 vote, and was signed into law by Governor Dave Heineman.


=== Committee assignments ===
Executive Board and the Revenue Committee
Transportation and Telecommunications Committee (Chair)


== U.S. Senate (2013–Present) ==


=== 2012 election ===


==== Primary ====
In January 2012, after incumbent Democratic Senator Ben Nelson announced his retirement, Fischer officially announced she would run for the U.S. Senate. The Republican primary campaign was expected to shape up as a battle between Attorney General Jon Bruning and State Treasurer Don Stenberg; Fischer and three less well-known candidates were also on the ballot.
During the primary campaign, Fischer was criticized by environmentalists and others because her family's ranch near Valentine grazed cattle on federal land, leasing it for about $110,000 per year less than the market rate on private land. Opponents of federal grazing leases argued that she should relinquish her family's permit if she wants to remain "morally consistent" with her message of less government. Fischer argued that the poor quality of federal lands, plus the restrictions that come with federal leases, make it inappropriate to compare them to private leases.
In the campaign, Fischer was outspent by Bruning, who raised $3.6 million, and Stenberg, who spent $865,000. Fischer's campaign raised only $440,000. However, Bruning and Stenberg spent much of their resources attacking one another; Fischer benefitted from the damage that each did to the other's approval ratings. She was also aided by $725,000 in television ads bought by the Club for Growth attacking Bruning. Shortly before the election, she was endorsed by Nebraska U.S. Representative Jeff Fortenberry and by 2008 Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who recorded robocalls endorsing her; and a super PAC financed by former Omaha businessman Joe Ricketts paid for $250,000 worth of television advertising promoting Fischer and opposing Bruning.
Fischer won the primary election with 40% of the vote. Bruning ranked second with 35%, and Stenberg ranked third with 18%. Fischer took a plurality of votes in 75 of Nebraska's 93 counties. Bruning won 15 counties and Schuyler businessman Pat Flynn received a plurality in his home Colfax County. Fischer and Bruning tied in Kimball and Sioux counties.


==== General election ====
In the general election, Fischer faced Democrat Bob Kerrey, a former Nebraska governor and U.S. senator, who was running for the seat that he had held from 1989 to 2001.
In the course of the campaign, Kerrey's advertising accused Fischer of unprincipled conduct in the matter of a 1995 adverse possession suit, whereunder the Fischers had attempted to obtain title to 104 acres (42 ha) of land adjoining their property. The Kerrey campaign maintained that Fischer, after losing the lawsuit, had used her position in the Legislature to keep the landowners from selling the property to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (NGPC). The episode, declared a Kerrey website, had shown "[n]eighbor suing neighbor; vindictiveness; pettiness; deceit; abuse of power". Fischer maintained that their intent in filing the suit was to obtain a more manageable boundary for their ranch, after repeated attempts to purchase the land had failed; an Omaha World-Herald analysis stated that the Kerrey campaign's statements regarding Fischer's actions in the Legislature failed to mention her support for a compromise measure that would have allowed NGPC to buy the land. A Fischer spokesman accused Kerrey of "reckless disregard for the truth" and "gutter politics" in the matter.
In the general election, Fischer defeated Kerrey 58%–42%. Fischer won mainly by swamping Kerrey in the state's rural areas. She won 88 of Nebraska's 93 counties. Kerrey only won Douglas, Lancaster, Saline, Thurston, and Dakota counties.
Fischer became the third female U.S. Senator in Nebraska's history, and the first since 1954. She was the first elected to a full term: of the earlier woman Senators, Eva Bowring was appointed in 1954 to occupy the seat vacated by the death of Dwight Griswold until a special election could be held to replace him later that year; Hazel Abel won that special election to finish Griswold's term, but did not seek a full term.


=== Positions ===
In Fischer's 2012 campaign materials, she quoted several politicians and editorials describing her as a "true conservative" and a "staunch conservative".
Fischer supports a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution and has signed Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge promising not to raise taxes on individuals and businesses. She has also declared herself opposed to cuts in entitlement programs for Americans over the age of 40.
In her 2012 campaign literature, Fischer stated that she "would vote to fully repeal Obamacare."
Fischer describes herself as "proud to be pro-life", and cites her endorsements from Nebraska Right to Life and from the Susan B. Anthony List.
Fischer's 2012 campaign materials state that she "[s]upports the federal marriage amendment". She opposes same-sex marriage.
According to Fischer's 2012 campaign literature, she has "opposed every attempt effort [sic] by groups seeking to restrict our right to own firearms."
In her 2012 campaign materials, Fischer declared, "The EPA must be reformed and possibly eliminated". She stated that current greenhouse-gas regulations needed to be made less restrictive, and expressed her opposition to a cap-and-trade policy.
In Fischer's 2012 campaign materials, she expressed support for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution limiting Senators to two six-year terms, and U.S. Representatives to three two-year terms. She pledged to "limit herself to two terms in office." She also stated that members of the U.S. Congress should be placed under a lifetime ban from becoming federally registered lobbyists.
Fischer's 2012 campaign website states that she "[o]pposes amnesty and benefits for illegal aliens", that she voted against Nebraska's version of the DREAM Act in its passage in 2006, and that she co-sponsored a bill to repeal the state act in 2010.


=== Tenure ===
Fischer voted for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. She voted against Chuck Hagel's nomination as Secretary of Defense. She voted against expanding background checks for gun buyers and other gun control measures.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Expand the military **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: We have an obligation as the leaders of the world to maintain a strong military. And we have an obligation to our service personnel to pay them adequately. 
  * **Support** means you believe: We should consider carefully before making more cuts - for example, base closings have hurt local economies, and reducing military personnel has put pressure on employment. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Build smart, not necessarily big. Money is often better spent on issues other than defense. We should cut back on troops stationed abroad and focus on quality of our troops instead of quantity. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Defense spending includes huge amounts of pork-barrel spending and should be reduced dramatically. We should change our Defense policy to one of defense, instead of one where we police the world. Pull US troops out of Europe, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere. We are wrong to have a military that is as large as the rest of the world combined. 

This question is looking for your views on military spending in general.
However you answer the above question would be similar to your response to
these statements:

  * Improve military readiness 
  * Rebuild the `Hollow Military'
  * Maintain our troop commitments overseas
  * Men and women in the armed services are paid shamefully little
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of American strength abroad. 
  * **Support** means you believe that we need more spending to keep up with our **practical** national security requirements. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe that a better **practical** use of military funding would be on social programs or other domestic spending. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** that an overly-large US military hurts our security interests by making enemies abroad and destroying our economy in the long run. 

**

#### The War on Terrorism

[![](../images/afghanMap_detail.gif)](../images/afghanMap_detail.gif)

  * On **Sept. 11, 2001**, terrorists hijacked four commercial jets from Boston and Washington, and flew them into the World Trade Center in NYC and the Pentagon outside DC, destroying the Twin Towers and killing over 6,000 people. It was the worst terrorist incident in history. 
  * Pres. Bush appointed Tom Ridge as the "terrorism czar," formally creating a cabinet-level post for a new **Office of Homeland Security**, initially funding it with $40 billion. 
  * NATO invoked **Article 5** of its charter, which commits 18 European allies to military action in response to an attack on the homeland of the US. 
  * The primary suspect is **Osama bin Laden**, an exiled Saudi millionaire based in Afghanistan. 
  * The CIA formerly funded bin Laden as a leader of the **mujaheddin**, or freedom fighters, when the Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan through the 1980s. 
  * Bin Laden turned against the US when troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War in 1990. He issued a **fatwa**, or religious edict, calling for the removal of US troops from the Holy Lands of Mecca and Medina. 
  * Bin Laden's organization, **al Qaeda**, which means "The Base," funds terrorist training and operations, and has been implicated in past terrorist actions in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 2000 USS Cole bombing, and the 1998 simultaneous attack on two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
  * The US responded to the embassy bombings by a **cruise-missile attack** aimed at bin Laden, terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and chemical factories in Sudan. The US also by indicting bin Laden in US criminal court. 
  * **The Taliban** is the Muslim fundamentalist political party which rules most of Afghanistan. They were the largest army of the mujaheddin, and were also funded by the CIA in the 1980s. Their leader is Mullah Mohammad Omar. 
  * The Taliban rules under **Shari'ah**, or Islamic law as described in the Koran, which implies strict interpretation of moral codes and numerous personal restrictions. 
  * A portion of Afghanistan is ruled by the **Northern Alliance**, another mujaheddin group. Their leader was assassinated in the week preceding the World Trade Center attack; it is unknown whether there was a connection. 
  * The exiled king of Afghanistan, **Muhammad Zahir Shah,** has agreed to participate in a coalition government if the Taliban is overthrown. King Zahir is 86 years old, and has resided in Rome since 1973. 
  * Afghanistan's neighbors are: 
    * Pakistan (which shares the Afghan ethnicity of Pashtun in its northern provinces); 
    * Iran (which shares the Northern Alliance's religion of Shi'a Islam); 
    * Tajikistan (a former Soviet republic, which also has a Shi'a minority); 
    * Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (two other former Soviet republics; they are majority Sunni Muslim, like the Taliban); 
    * and China (bordering its Muslim province, known as Xinjiang in Chinese and Uighurstan in Arabic, where there are regular Islamic uprisings). 
  * The Taliban is recognized only by Pakistan; Saudi Arabia and Yemen, the only other countries to have recognized the Taliban, severed diplomatic ties in late September. 
  * **Pakistan** supplied the mujaheddin before and after the Soviet occupation. Complicating relations with the US, Pakistan exploded a nuclear device in 1998, in response to India's doing so. India and Pakistan have been fighting a sporadic war for decades over the Kashmir region.

#### History of Yugoslavia

[![](../images/YUGO_MAP.JPG)](../images/YUGO_BIG.JPG) Yugoslavia was created
after WWI, from a federation of Balkan countries. The intention was avoiding
further Balkan wars like those which ignited WWI. After WWII, its borders were
redrawn with six republics plus two provinces within Serbia. (click on the map
below left for an [enlarged view](YUGO_BIG.JPG)).

#### Sovereignty

The six Yugoslav republics (see below) have all had history as independent
nations. The two provinces within Serbia (Kosovo and Vojvodina) were never
independent, with legal status like California within the US. Hence much of
the debate on Kosovo centers on 'sovereignty' -- attacking Kosovo can be
viewed as an attack on the sovereignty of Serbia while it was involved in a
Civil War. Bosnia, on the other hand, had autonomous legal status like Puerto
Rico within the US. Bosnia had declared independence from Serbia before the US
sent troops there, and hence sovereignty was not an issue.

#### Marshal Tito

Marshal Tito was the Communist leader of Yugoslavia since WWII. He is credited
with holding the Yugoslav republics together (by dictatorial force), and after
he died in 1980 the republics began to clamor for more autonomy. Further
pressure for independence came from the fall of the Soviet empire in 1989.

#### Breakup of Yugoslavia

In 1990, a new Yugoslav Constitution was enacted. Four republics soon declared
independence, leaving 'Rump Yugoslavia' as only Serbia plus Montenegro. Status
of the former Yugoslav republics and provinces:

    1. **_Slovenia: **_ Declared independence in June 1991; one-week war with Serbia (a 'bloodless' war because Serbia focused on Croatia); Slovenia is now a prospering nation with hopes of joining NATO. 
    2. **_Croatia: **_ Declared independence in June 1991; longer war with Serbia; heavily involved with Bosnia war. 
    3. **_Macedonia: **_ Declared independence in Nov. 1991; avoided war because of arrival of international forces (including US forces, which are still based there). Greece has blocked full international recognition because the name 'Macedonia' is also the name of a Greek province. 
    4. **_Bosnia-Herzegovina: **_ Declared independence in 1992; lengthy war with Serbia and Croatia, with all three countries involved in 'ethnic cleansing.' The war ended with the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. US forces are still stationed in Bosnia, which is partitioned into three ethnic regions (Serb, Bosnian, & Croat). 
    5. **_Montenegro: **_ Still part of Yugoslavia as an autonomous Republic. Montenegrins are ethnically identical to Serbs; they differ only by geography. But in the wake of the Kosovo war, Montenegro may declare independence. 
    6. **_Serbia: **_ Legally, Serbia is just one republic of Yugoslavia. But the Serbs have always been the dominant group in all of Yugoslavia since is formation. 
    7. **_Kosovo: **_ Remains a province within the republic of Serbia. Its population is 3/4 Albanian (referred to as 'ethnic Albanians' to differentiate from residents of the neighboring country of Albania). 
    8. **_Vojvodina: **_ Also remains a province within the republic of Serbia. Its population is 1/2 Hungarian (they border Hungary, and prior to WWII were part of that country). 

#### Slobodan Milosevic

  * Milosevic came to power as Chairman of the Communist Party in 1986. 
  * His popularity increased greatly in 1987 after a speech in Kosovo strongly advocating Serbian nationalism (the speech was made on the site of a 14th century battlefield. This is the political basis for Milosevic not granting Kosovo independence). 
  * Milosevic was democratically elected President of Serbia in 1989, and elected as President of Yugoslavia in 1997. 
  * He was indicted as a war criminal in June 1999, the first time a sitting President has been indicted. His alleged crimes include genocide and ethnic cleansing. 
  * In October 2000, Milosevic lost the presidential election to Vlajislav Kostunica. Milosevic gave up power after widespread protests and Russian urging. 
  * In April 2001, Milosevic surrendered to Serbian government forces. He faces extradition to an international tribunal as well as domestic charges. 

#### Religion and Ethnicity

The major religious divisions in Yugoslavia explain much of the political
divisions:

  * _**Eastern Orthodoxy **_ is the religion of the Serbs, Macedonians, and Montenegrins. Hence Russia (who are also Eastern Orthodox and ethnically Slavic) support the Serbs, and Greece (who consider Macedonians ethnically Greek) identifies with Macedonia. 
  * _**Roman Catholicism **_ is the religion of the Croats, Slovenes, and Hungarians. Hence Croatia and Slovenia are religiously distinct from Serbia even though they are all ethnically Slavic. 
  * _**Islam **_ is the religion of the Bosnians and the Albanians (including those in Kosovo). Hence the country of Bosnia-Herzegovina is all ethnically Slavic but has three distinct religious groups. 

#### Kosovo

In 1999, the US and NATO negotiated with Milosevic in Rambouillet, France,
attempting to resolve the Kosovo crisis without ethnic cleansing or war. The
goal was to be a 'Rambouillet Agreement' fashioned after the Dayton Agreement
that ended the war in Bosnia. The peace talks failed, and NATO bombed Serbia
and Kosovo from March to June 1999. Milosevic capitulated; the Serbian Army
left Kosovo; and NATO, Russian, and UN troops are now stationed there under
the 'KFOR' banner.

#### Israel & Palestine

[![](../images/Israel_Map.gif)](../images/Israel_Map.gif)

  * 1948: The UN partitioned British Palestine into a Jewish state (Israel) and an Arab state (Palestine). Six Arab countries declared war on Israel; Israel survived with borders different than those drawn by the UN; these are now known as the "pre-1967 borders." Palestine did not survive; the East Bank and West Bank of the Jordan River were taken over by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip was taken over by Egypt. Many Palestinians became refugees in the 1948 war; they have still not been resettled and are the subject of the current debate on "right of return." 
  * 1956: Britain, France, & Israel invaded Egypt to force open the Suez Canal; they briefly occupied the Sinai Desert until pressured by the US and UN to withdraw. 
  * 1967: Israel won the "Six Day War" and occupied Gaza & Sinai (from Egypt); the West Bank (from Jordan); and the Golan Heights (from Syria). Jerusalem, split in 1948 between Israel & Palestine (and then Jordan), was unified under Israel; they annexed the whole city in 1980. 
  * 1973: A bloody war ended with no changed borders, but established the groundwork for an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979. Egypt's president, Anwar Sadat, shared with Israel's Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980 for his efforts, but paid for it with his life in an assassination in 1981. As part of the Egyptian peace treaty, Israel withdrew from Sinai (but not Gaza). The shaky peace has held up since, with regular US intervention and billions of dollars of annual US aid to both Egypt and Israel. 
  * 1982: Israel invaded Lebanon in response to terrorist attackes by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Israel surrounded the Lebanese capital, Beirut, forcing the PLO and its chairman, Yaserr Arafat, to withdraw. Israel began its withdrawl from Lebanon in 1985; Syria still occupies parts of the country. Israel also began establishing settlements on the West Bank in the late 1970s, which are a major point of contention in today's peace negotiations. 
  * 1987: Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank began an uprising against Israel, called "the Intifadeh." The PLO's Arafat signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, granting Palestine eventual self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank \-- this is the peace treaty which is still being phased in today. Jordan also signed a peace treaty with Israel, in 1994. 
  * 1996: Arafat is elected president of the "Palestinian Authority", and renounces the PLO Charter's clause calling for the destruction of Israel. In 1998, the Wye River Accords (under Pres. Clinton) negotiated further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. In 2000, a "Second Intifadeh" began in the West Bank; it continues today. 

* * *

#### Persian Gulf

[![](../images/iraq_Map.gif)](../images/iraq_Map.gif)

  * The Iraq War formally ended on Dec. 15, 2011. Approximately 5,000 "security contractors" will remain to guard the US Embassy in Baghdad, plus several thousand more "general support contractors." Another 9,000 US troops are just over the border in Kuwait.   
  
IRAQ HISTORY:  
  

  * Throughout most of the 1980s, Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war. It ended with no border changes, and without any US intervention. 
  * In 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, claiming it as a province of Iraq. The US and numerous allied assembled by Pres. George H. W. Bush built up a counterforce in Saudi Arabia and succeeded in 1991 in pushing Saddam's army out of Kuwait. 
  * On the 10th anniversary of the Gulf War, President-elect George W Bush declared Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein "a big threat" and said he must be contained - by military force if necessary. 
  * In Jan 2001, outgoing President Clinton signed and transmitted to Congress a report on the provision of assistance to the Iraqi opposition. The report outlines plans for the transfer of humanitarian assistance for the relief of the Iraqi people and for radio and television broadcasting by the Iraqi National Congress (INC). The report also identifies certain issues that must be resolved in relation to implementation of those plans. 
  * The primary purpose of the provision is to assist those Iraqis who have been displaced from their homes or who are not receiving adequate assistance from the UN and other assistance organizations. 
  * Kuwaiti society is still deeply conservative. A strong Islamic current runs through the country-Islamists are fairly well represented in parliament and there is the odd Islamic extremist attack, against video stores or women not wearing the veil.
