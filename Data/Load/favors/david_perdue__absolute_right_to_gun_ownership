David Alfred Perdue, Jr. (born December 10, 1949) is an American politician who is the junior United States Senator from Georgia, having been elected to the seat previously held by Saxby Chambliss, who retired. Perdue won the most votes in the Republican primary election in Georgia on May 20, 2014, and defeated Representative Jack Kingston in the runoff on July 22, 2014. Perdue defeated Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn on November 4, 2014, and took office on January 3, 2015.


== Early life and education ==
Perdue was born in Macon, Georgia, the son of David Alfred Perdue, Sr., and the former Gervaise Wynn, both schoolteachers. He was raised in Warner Robins, Georgia. He lives with his wife, Bonnie Dunn Perdue, in the resort town of Sea Island. The couple have two sons, David A. Perdue III and Blake Perdue, and three grandchildren. He is the first cousin of former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue.
Perdue has a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering (1972) and a master's degree in operations research (1975), both from Georgia Tech. At Georgia Tech, Perdue was a brother of the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity.


== Business career ==
Perdue began his career at Kurt Salmon Associates, an international consulting firm, where he worked for twelve years as a management consultant. His first major corporate job was as senior vice president of Asia operations for Sara Lee Corporation, a position he took in 1992. His time at Sara Lee was followed by a stint at Haggar Clothing, where he became senior vice president of operations in 1994.
In 1998, Perdue joined Reebok as a senior vice president, eventually rising to president and CEO. Perdue is credited with significantly reducing the company's debt and reviving its sneaker line. Perdue negotiated a contract with the National Football League that a former Reebok executive referred to as "revolutionary" for repositioning the company's shoe brand.
In 2002, Perdue left Reebok for Pillowtex, a North Carolina textile company. The company had recently emerged from bankruptcy with a heavy debt load and an underfunded pension liability. Perdue was unable to obtain additional funding from the company's investors and later was unsuccessful in finding a buyer for the company. He left the company in 2003 after nine months on the job and $1.7 million in compensation. Pillowtex closed several months later, leaving 7,650 workers out of work nationwide. With more than 4,000 jobs lost statewide, it was the largest single day job loss in North Carolina history at the time.
After leaving Pillowtex, Perdue became CEO of Dollar General. Prior to his joining the company, it had recently overstated profits by $100 million and paid $162 million to settle shareholder lawsuits. Perdue overhauled the company's inventory line and logistics network and updated its marketing strategy. After initially closing hundreds of stores, the company doubled its stock price and opened 2,600 new stores before being sold in 2007 to private equity investors.
From 2007 to 2009, Perdue worked as a senior consultant for Indian chemical textile conglomerate Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Ltd. In April 2011, Perdue started an Atlanta-based global trading firm.
According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Perdue is "known on Wall Street as a turnaround specialist who helps revive brands and reap rewards for investors."

=== 2014 Senate campaign ===

Perdue touted his business experience, and particularly his experience at Dollar General, in running for office. According to Perdue: "We added about 2,200 stores, created almost 20,000 jobs and doubled the value of that company in a very short period of time. Not because of me, but because we listened to our customers and employees.‚Äù He received the endorsement of the National Federation of Independent Business.
Perdue's political opponents targeted his business career during the campaign, specifically for outsourcing work, which Perdue stated he was "proud of", and for the job losses that followed the final closure of Pillowtex. After being elected, Perdue stated that he wanted to bring the perspective of a working person to Washington D.C.
The race was considered to be a competitive race. Perdue won the general election, defeating the Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn 52.89% to 45.21%.

== Political positions ==
Perdue stated that he entered politics out of concern for the rising national debt. He supports repealing and replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He also supports a constitutional balanced budget amendment and comprehensive tax reform. In addition, he pledged to limit himself to two terms in the Senate, equivalent to 12 years.
In October 2015, Perdue voted in favor of the CISA (Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act), despite strong opposition from major companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Twitter. This is consistent with his record of a "Common Defense" as he also supported the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act).
In a June 2016 speech to a conference of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, Perdue urged the audience to pray for President Obama's "days to be short".

** Absolute right to gun ownership **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: The right to bear arms is a basic Constitutional right and expresses the democratic principle of self-defense against tyrannical government. Leave gun rights as they are. 
  * **Support** means you believe: It's not the instrument, it's the morality. Gun ownership should not be restricted - most gun owners use them safely and responsibly. To reduce gun-related crimes, address the moral problems of society and other issues. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: The only "gun right" is to self-defense against criminals and the right to a secure home and a secure person. Tighten registration rules and keep guns away from kids. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: More guns mean more killing. Limit availability of guns by whatever means are effective. The 2nd amendment does not mean an unlimited right to any and all firearms. 

This question is looking for your views on Second Amendment rights. However
you answer the above question would be similar to your response to these
statements:

  * The Second Amendment is one of our most important right
  * If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.
  * People kill, not guns
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principles** of the Second Amendment as a fundamental right. 
  * **Support** means you believe in the **practical** benefits of gun rights, such as self-protection and hunting. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe **practical** reforms are needed, like bans on assault weapons and certain ammunition. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** that the Second Amendment does not apply to individuals.

****BACKGROUND**

**Statistics on Gun Ownership**
* 40% of all US homes have guns 
* 81% of Americans say that gun control will be an important issue in determining which Congressional candidate to vote for. 
* 91% of Americans say that there should be at least minor restrictions on gun ownership; 
* 57% of Americans say that there should be major restrictions or a ban. 

**Child-Safety Locks**  

* In 1996, 140 children died after being accidentally shot. 
* About 1,500 children are hurt by guns every year. 
* "Trigger Locks" require entering a combination to use the gun (or some other locking method); they are intended to reduce inadvertent use by children or other unauthorized users. 

**Background Checks**  

* The "Gun-Show Loophole" means that there are no background checks when purchasing guns in a private transaction. 
* Guns sold at gun shows through dealers ARE subject to background checks; only those sold privately are not. 

**Right to Bear Arms**  

* The Supreme Court ruled in 1939, in a case called "US v. Miller," that the 2nd amendment only protects guns suitable for a well-regulated militia -- for example, sawed-off shotguns can be banned because they're not "ordinary military equipment". 
* Since 1939, the Supreme Court has not heard many further 2nd amendment cases; the most recent ruling prior to Heller, in 1997, overturned part of the 1993 Brady Bill, but did not address 2nd amendment rights. 
* Heller refers to a ruling on the issue of individual rights. The Supreme Court ruled, in the 2008 case called District of Columbia v. Heller, that the 2nd Amendment does define an individual right to gun ownership, as opposed to a collective right for a state-run and state-armed National Guard. 
* Much discretion was left to the states and to Congress, but Heller opens up the issue to further Supreme Court cases. 
* Hence, gun control issues are still primarily the subject of Congressional legislation. 

**Gun Control Buzzwords**  

* The biggest component of the Gun Control debate is whether existing gun laws are sufficient, or whether more gun laws are needed. 
* Liberals and populists generally favor more gun laws. Look for buzzwords like "more registration" or "more licensing" to describe seeking further restrictions legal ownership; or "close the loopholes" and "restrict access" for further restrictions on illegal ownership. 
* Moderate liberals and populists will generally favor more restrictions on ownership while paying lip-service "sportsmen's rights" or respecting "the right of self-protection." A moderate compromise is to "extend waiting periods" before allowing ownership, to perform "background checks" of varying degrees of severity. 
* Conservatives and libertarians generally oppose gun laws. Look for buzzwords like "Second Amendment rights" or "allow concealed carry". A call for "instant background checks" pays lip-service to gun-control advocates: it sounds like a restriction, but means allowing purchasing guns on the spot. 
* Moderate conservatives and libertarians oppose gun laws while acknowledging that restrictions are inevitable. Look for buzzwords like "enforce existing gun laws," which implies not passing any NEW gun laws. Similarly, "more strict enforcement" of gun laws implies a pro-Gun Rights stance, unless it is accompanied by a call for new gun laws. 
* Centrists and moderates from both the right and left generally support restrictions on juvenile access to guns, especially in the wake of tragedies like Littleton and other gun-related deaths. 
* Positive mentions of the NRA (the National Rifle Association, the largest pro-gun rights lobbying group) implies support of gun rights, while opposing the NRA or "taking on the gun lobby" implies support of gun restrictions. 

**Amendment II to the US Constitution**  
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. (1791)
