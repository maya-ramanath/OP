Roy Dean Blunt (born January 10, 1950) is the junior United States Senator from Missouri, in office since 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Blunt served as the United States Representative from Missouri's 7th congressional district from 1997 to 2011. The district contains most of Southwest Missouri, anchored in the city of Springfield, as well as cities such as Joplin, Carthage, and Neosho. The popular tourist destination of Branson also lies in the district.
Blunt served as House Majority Whip from 2003 to 2007, and was acting House Majority Leader from September 2005 to February 2006. He was the House Minority Whip during the 110th Congress starting in 2007, but after the 2008 general elections announced that he would step down from the position.
Blunt successfully ran for United States Senate in 2010. In 2011, he was elected vice-chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.
Blunt is the father of Matt Blunt, the governor of Missouri from 2005 to 2009. At 54, he was the youngest father of a governor of any state. Also he was one of the few politicians who remained active on the political scene while his son was a governor. He and his son are the only Republicans to have served as Missouri Secretary of State since 1945.


== Early life and education ==
Blunt was born in Niangua, Missouri, the son of Neva Dora (née Letterman) and Leroy Blunt. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in history from Southwest Baptist University in 1970. In college he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. During his time in college, he received three draft deferments from the Vietnam War. Two years later, he earned a master's degree in history from Missouri State University (then Southwest Missouri State University). Blunt was a high school history teacher at Marshfield High School and taught at Drury University. He later served four years as president of Southwest Baptist University.


== Early political career (1972–1997) ==

=== Tenure ===
Education
Blunt has voted in favor of school prayer and supported the No Child Left Behind Act. He has voted in favor of school vouchers within the District of Columbia but has voted against broader legislation allowing states to use federal money to issue vouchers for private or religious schools. He has received a 17 percent rating from the National Education Association.
Fiscal issues
Blunt received a 97 percent rating from the United States Chamber of Commerce indicating a pro-business voting record. He supported efforts to overhaul U.S. bankruptcy laws, requiring consumers who seek bankruptcy protection to repay more of their debts.
Blunt is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibitions of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.
Blunt opposes the federal cap and trade legislation and supports drilling for oil on the U.S. coastline. Blunt does not believe in man-made global warming, stating: "There isn't any real science to say we are altering the climate or path of the Earth."
Gun rights
Blunt has voted to prohibit lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers if the guns they manufacture or sell are later used in a crime. He has also voted to reduce the waiting period for purchasing a gun from 72 hours to 24 hours. He has received an "A" rating from the National Rifle Association.
In April 2013, Senator Blunt was one of forty-six senators to vote against the passing of a bill which would have expanded background checks for all gun buyers. Blunt voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop the bill. 
Healthcare
Blunt, who chairs the House Republican Health Care Solutions Group, has opposed plans for health care reform supported by Democrats, including proposals that include a "public option" of medical insurance offered by the government. In July 2009 he suggested that the government should not have created Medicare and Medicaid, saying:

The government did get into the health care business in a big way in 1965 with Medicare and later with Medicaid. And government already distorts the marketplace. A government competitor would drive all of the other competitors away. What we should be doing is creating more competition.

In August 2009, Blunt stated in two separate newspaper interviews that, because he was 59 years old, "In either Canada or Great Britain, if I broke my hip, I couldn't get it replaced." Blunt stated that he had heard the statement in Congressional testimony by "some people who are supposed to be experts on Canadian health care." The PolitiFact service of the St. Petersburg Times reported that it could not find any such testimony.
Blunt opposes efforts to end the practice of charging higher rates to unhealthier groups of people. Instead, he suggests expanding the risk pool to make healthcare affordable for those people.
Blunt favors allowing dependent children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until after the age of 27.
Social issues
Although Missouri Right to Life endorsed Webster over Blunt in the 1992 Republican gubernatorial primary, Blunt has voted pro-life in the House and has a conservative record on most other social issues. He has voted to ban partial-birth abortions and to restrict or criminalize transporting minors across state lines for the purpose of getting an abortion. He opposes federal funding for elective abortions in accordance with the Hyde Amendment. He also voted in favor of the unsuccessful Federal Marriage Amendment which sought to place a national ban on same-sex marriage, and has voted against gay adoption. He received 94 percent lifetime and 96 percent 2004 ratings from the conservative American Conservative Union, a 14 percent rating from the American Civil Liberties Union, and a 92 percent rating from the conservative Christian Coalition. In 2012, he suggested the "Blunt Amendment" an addition to a highway appropriations bill to block part of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that requires all insurance plans to cover the birth control pill. The proposed amendment would have allowed not only religious organizations, but any employer with a "moral objection" to opt out of birth control coverage. The amendment was ultimately defeated. 
Agricultural issues
Blunt anonymously introduced an amendment, the Farmer Assurance Provision, into a March 2013 spending resolution. The amendment, dubbed the "Monsanto protection act" by its critics, mandates that if the regulation status of a GMO crop is challenged and a federal court issues an injunction against said GMO crop to stop the planting of the crop while the secretary of agriculture considers the non-regulation petition, the secretary shall immediately grant temporary authority to farmers to disregard the federal court injunction. According to Blunt, "What it says is if you plant a crop that is legal to plant when you plant it, you get to harvest it." Blunt later led Senate Republicans in defeating an amendment by Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley to repeal the provision. Blunt said that all the amendment does "was repeat authority that the secretary in a hearing the other day, before the Agri[culture] Approp[riations] committee the other day, said he already had. And it didn't require the secretary to do anything that the secretary thought was the wrong thing to do. Which is one of the reasons I thought it was fine..."


=== Leadership ===
After only one term, Blunt was appointed as Chief Deputy Whip, the highest appointed position in the House Republican Caucus. In that capacity, he served as the Republicans' chief vote-counter. In 2002, when Dick Armey retired and fellow Texan Tom DeLay was elected to succeed him, Blunt was elected to succeed DeLay as House Majority Whip.
Blunt served as Majority Leader on an acting basis starting in September 2005, after DeLay was indicted on felony charges involving campaign finance. On January 8, 2006, one day after DeLay announced that he would not seek to regain his position, Blunt announced he would run to permanently replace DeLay. On January 14, 2006, he issued a release claiming that the majority of the Republican caucus had endorsed him as DeLay's successor. However, when the election was held by secret ballot on February 2, 2006, U.S. Representative John Boehner of Ohio won on the second ballot, with 122 votes to 109 for Blunt. In November 2006, Blunt was elected by House Republicans to their second-highest position during the 110th Congress, House Minority Whip. Blunt handily defeated U.S. Representative John Shadegg of Arizona for the position. He announced that he would step down from the position in late 2008, following two successive election cycles where House Republicans had lost seats and to avoid a difficult battle with his deputy, Eric Cantor, who was urged by some to challenge Blunt for the position of Republican Whip.


=== Committee assignments ===
Upon entering the U.S. House, Blunt served on the House International Relations Committee, the House Committee on Agriculture, and the House Transportation Committee. In 1999, he gave up seats on the latter two committees and joined the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce. In addition he became a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He has also served on the Republican Conference Steering Committee since his election to the U.S. House of Representatives, a committee that determines to which committees Republican members of the House are assigned and elevates members to positions of ranking member or chair.


== U.S. Senate (2011–present) ==


=== 2010 election ===

On February 19, 2009, Blunt announced he would seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate election for the seat being vacated by incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kit Bond. He successfully ran against Democratic nominee Secretary of State Robin Carnahan, Constitution Party nominee Jerry Beck, Libertarian nominee Jonathan Dine, and write-in candidates Mark S. Memoly, Frazier Miller, Jeff Wirick and Richie L. Wolfe.


=== Tenure ===
The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2011, that "Blunt introduced an amendment to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that would allow an employer to deny health services if they conflict with their 'religious beliefs or moral convictions'." (see Blunt Amendment) Blunt said of the amendment “was it an overreach when Mrs. Clinton put it in the Clinton health care plan in 1994? I don’t think it’s an overreach at all. It doesn’t mention any specific procedure. It doesn’t even suggest the mandate should be eliminated.”
In July 2013, Blunt indicated that he would not support efforts to tie raising the federal debt ceiling to defunding Obamacare. In an interview on MSNBC, he expressed his opinion that Obamacare is "destined to fail", but that raising the debt ceiling shouldn't be "held hostage" to "any specific thing".


=== Death Tax Repeal Act ===
On June 20, 2013, Senator Blunt co-sponsored the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2013. The bill is intended to permanently eliminate federal estate tax on family farms, ranches, and small businesses.


=== Other legislative activity ===
On January 17, 2014, Senator Blunt introduced a bill called the Partnership to Build America Act. If signed into law, the bill would create a special fund to pay for infrastructure projects across the United States, according to Ripon Advance.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Appropriations
Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee on Defense
Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Chairman)

== Personal life ==
Blunt has been married twice. He married Roseann Ray in May 1967 and had three children with her: Matt (the former Governor of Missouri), Amy Blunt Mosby and Andrew Blunt. Blunt and Ray divorced after 35 years of marriage. Afterward, he married Abigail Perlman, a lobbyist for Kraft Foods, on October 18, 2003. In April 2006, he and his wife adopted an 18-month-old boy from Russia, whom they renamed Alexander Charles "Charlie" Blunt.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Make voter registration easier **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support ** means you believe: 
  * Voter ID laws are racist and intended to suppress minority voting. 
  * More enforcement of right to vote, not enforcement against voters. 
  * Public funds should be used for political campaigns. 
  * The best way to reduce the influence of big-money lobbyists and special interests is to remove as much money as possible from campaigning. Free television time would be a good start. 
  * **Support** means you believe: 
  * Voter ID laws just make it harder for people to vote, and we should work to make it EASIER to vote. 
  * Reforms are needed in campaign finance, in order to reduce the influence of moneyed interests. 
  * Those reforms might include restrictions on personal donations to political campaigns; restrictions on corporate, labor union, or PAC donations; and restrictions on PAC activities. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: 
  * ID requirements for voting are reasonable. 
  * Politicians will always find loopholes in any campaign finance reform, so the best approach is just to monitor campaigns for lawbreaking and leave the rest to the press. Better reporting of donations would be useful. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: 
  * Voter fraud undermines the most fundamental process of democracy, and we need to fight it. 
  * Campaign donations are free speech, and should not be limited for corporations nor for individuals. PACs and 527 committees should be similarly allowed free speech via unlimited spending on any issue or any candidate they choose. 

This question is looking for your views on whether wealthy individuals should
have an unlimited right to finance political candidates (including
themselves). However you answer the above question would be similar to your
response to these statements:

  * Require TV networks to provide free air time to candidates 
  * Stricter limits on political campaign funds 
  * Voter ID laws are racist 
  * Suppressing the vote is incumbency protection 
  * Overturn _Citizens United_ via a Constitutional Amendment 
  * Include a checkoff box on tax returns for optional $1 contributions 
  * Support "Clean Election" laws where candidates receive funding if they agree to spending limits 
  * Restrict PAC (political action committees) spending on individual campaigns. 
  * Restrict the activities of 527 committees (independent fundraising entities such as MoveOn.org or the Swift Boat Veterans committee) 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of taxpayer funding for political campaigns. 
  * **Support** means you believe that restrictions on campaign finance, and/or partial public funding, is a **practical** means to reduce undue political influence. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe some **practical** reforms are needed, but that the basic system of privately financing political campaigns is acceptable. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that the **principle** of free speech applies to political campaign donations. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

**Campaign Finance Reform**
  * "McCain-Feingold" refers to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as BCRA, named after its sponsors, Sen. John McCain (R, AZ) and Sen. Russ Feingold (D, WI). McCain-Feingold doubled the campaign donation limit from $1,000 per person to $2,000 per person ($2,500 in 2012), known as "hard money." The law banned "soft money" contributions to political parties, but later Supreme Court cases, particularly "Citizens United," allowed unlimited soft money for purposes of advertising for or against a candidate as long as there was no "coordination" with the campaign. 

  * Citizens United refers to a 2010 Supreme Court case which allowed unlimited spending by Super-PACs on behalf of any candidate, as long as the TV ads are not coordinated with the campaign itself. Super-PACs dominate the spending in the 2012 presidential primaries. 

  * PAC money means donations to political action committees, which is used for issue ads which typically favor one candidate, but do not count in federal spending limits. 

  * Soft money means donations to the national party rather than to a particular candidate ($193 million in the 1998 election, for example). 

  * Hard money is subject to less reform proposals -- it means cash donations to a particular candidate, which must be fully reported to the FEC. 

  * Individuals may donate a maximum of $1000 to one candidate, but may donate any amount of soft money, and any amount to PACs. 

  * Candidates who volutarily limit their campaign spending qualify for federal matching funds of about $100 million. 

**Earmarks**
  * Earmark Reform" refers to changing the rules of Congress to restrict earmarks," which are currently legal and ethical. 

  * Earmarks" means line items in legislative bills which allocate specific monetary resources to a specific purpose (or to a specific company). 

  * An example is a highway improvement project in a House member's district, buried in a 1,000-page spending bill. 

  * Earmarks have become controversial because, in theory, members of Congress could quietly allocate an earmark that would benefit a campaign donor (known as pork-barrel spending"). 

  * Proposed reforms range from full disclosure (showing every earmark and its originating legislator on a public website) to the Line Item Veto (allowing the President to veto earmarks without vetoing the entire spending bill). 

**Czars**
  * The term "czar" refers to a powerful presidential appointee who is not confirmed by the Senate. In other words, a "czar" is answerable only to the President, unlike normal Cabinet secretaries and other appointees, who must pass the Senate confirmation process. 

  * "Czar" is an informal title used by the press and sometimes by the appointee. For example, [Elizabeth Warren](../Senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm) was known as the "Consumer Czar," but her formal title was "Special Advisor for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau." 

  * Czars were popularized by Pres. Clinton and the czar count increased to several dozen under Pres. George W. Bush and Pres. Obama, but the practice goes back to the 1930s. 

**Term Limits**
  * The Constitution limits the president to two terms, or a total of 10 years. There are not limits for the US House or the US Senate. 

  * In March 1998, the Supreme Court let stand term limits for state lawmakers, but previously ruled that establishing such restrictions nationally would require amending the Constitution. Efforts to limit federal Congressional terms died out in early 1997. 

  * 18 states have laws limiting politicians' terms, and in 1998, more than 200 state legislators were forced to retire. 

  * The latest push is for term limits for judges. The purpose would be to limit Judicial activism, which means establishing new laws from the bench rather than from Congress. 

**Balanced Budget Amendment**
  * In 1998, the Senate defeated by one vote a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the Constitution. It would have mandated an end to deficit spending unless 60% of Congress voted to override. 
  * State budget balancing requirements typically only apply to the _operating budget_ (ongoing expenses), but not to _capital expenditures_ (one-time investments). The proposed BBA restricts both. 
  * The Line Item Veto would be another Constitutional Amendment intended to reduce budget growth, by allowing the President to selectively veto particular spending items. 
  * Corporate welfare restrictions are often addressed in the context of a BBA or Line Item Veto. However, most federal corporate subsidies are embedded in the tax code rather than in the spending side of the budget. 

**Devolution to States**
  * Unfunded Mandates mean that the federal government requires states to undertake activities without providing funding for them. 
  * Block Grants mean that the federal government gives states funds to spend as each state sees fit. 
  * Devolution means the federal government should close departments and agencies, transfer functions to the states, or otherwise yield control over policy which is now federally controlled. The philosophy behind devolving power to the states is based in the 10th Amendment. It is currently appiled primarily to welfare reform. 

**Reinventing Government**
  * Reinvention has been the official policy of the federal government since 1993. The basic concepts are: 
  * Government should steer rather than row (provide a framework for non-government action rather than operate institutions). 
  * Government should focus on outcomes (desired results) and needs of customers (service recipients), rather than inputs (dollars and jobs) and needs of bureaucracies (rules). 
  * Government should decentralize and address problems from the lowest level of government possible; 
  * Public agencies should compete with private agencies, and should adopt a market orientation; 
  * Government which work betters also costs less. 

**Election Reform**
  * The GOP proposed a plan in May 2000, that small states would have primaries first, progressing to larger states over a four-month primary season. 
  * An older proposal is a system of regional primaries with a rotating right to go first. 
  * A constitutional amendment would be required to modify the Electoral College, but not to modify the primaries; many states in 2012 switched their GOP primaries from ['Winner-take-all' to 'Proportional'](../2012_WTA_vs_Proportional.htm).  

**Amendment X to the US Constitution** The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. (1791)
