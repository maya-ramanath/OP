Brian Emanuel Schatz (pronounced /ʃɑːtz/; born October 20, 1972) is an American politician who is the senior United States Senator for Hawaii. Schatz was appointed by Governor Neil Abercrombie to replace the U.S. senator Daniel Inouye after his death in 2012.
Schatz served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1998 to 2006, where he represented the 25th Legislative District, and was chairman of the Democratic Party of Hawaii from 2008 to 2010. He also worked as chief executive officer of Helping Hands Hawaii, an Oahu nonprofit social service agency, until he resigned to run for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in the 2010 Hawaii gubernatorial election as the running mate of Neil Abercrombie. He served as lieutenant governor until December 26, 2012, when Abercrombie appointed Schatz to serve out Daniel Inouye's U.S. Senate term until the 2014 special election. Upon his swearing-in, Schatz was the youngest U.S. Senator in the 112th Congress; in the current Congress, he is the fourth-youngest, after Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Schatz won the 2014 special election to complete his term.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
Schatz was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He is the son of Barbara Jane (Binder) and Irwin Jacob Schatz, a cardiologist and native of Saint Boniface, Manitoba. When Brian was two years old, his family moved to Hawaii, where he graduated from Punahou School. Schatz enrolled at Pomona College in Claremont, California; he spent a term studying in Kenya as part of the International Training Program, where he developed skills in public service. After graduating with a B.A. in philosophy, he returned to Hawaii, where he taught at Punahou before taking other jobs in the nonprofit sector. He became active in the community through his involvement in Youth for Environmental Services in the 1980s. He served as CEO of Helping Hands Hawaii and director of the Makiki Community Library and of the Center for a Sustainable Future. In March 2010, Schatz stepped down from Helping Hands to run for lieutenant governor.


== Hawaii House of Representatives (1998–2006) ==


=== Elections ===
In 1998, Schatz, a Democrat, challenged the incumbent State Representative of the 24th District of the Hawaii House of Representatives, Republican Sam Aiona, and won, 53%–47%. In the 2000 rematch, he was re-elected, 57%–43%. In 2002, he ran in the newly redrawn 25th House district, and defeated Republican Bill Hols, 69%–31%. In 2004, he defeated Republican Tracy Okubo 64%–36%. The 25th district, one of the densest and most diverse areas of urban Honolulu, includes Makiki, McCully, and Tantalus on the island of Oahu.


== Political career (2006–10) ==


=== 2006 congressional election ===

Schatz ran for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, vacated by Ed Case, who had decided to run for the U.S. Senate. The Democratic primary featured 10 candidates, seven of whom served in the Hawaii Legislature. Mazie Hirono, the Lieutenant Governor, was the only one who had held statewide office and thus enjoyed the most name recognition. She also raised more money than any other candidate in the race, mostly because of the endorsement of EMILY's List, and gave her campaign a personal loan of $100,000. Still, she won with just 22% of the vote, just 845 votes ahead of State Senator Colleen Hanabusa. State Representative Schatz ranked sixth with 7% of the vote, behind Hirono and four state senators.


=== Support for Obama ===
Schatz, one of the earliest supporters of Barack Obama for president, founded a group with other Hawaii Democrats in December 2006 to urge Obama to run. Schatz said, "For the last six years we've been governed by fear, fear of terrorists, fear of other countries, even fear of the other party...everyone is governing by fear and Barack Obama changes all of that. He wants to govern the United States by hope." In 2008, Schatz worked as spokesman for Obama's campaign in Hawaii.


=== State Chairman ===
In April 2008, he began running for the position of chairman of the Democratic Party of Hawaii, and won the job at the state convention the following month. During his tenure, the Democrats increased the number of active party members and delivered Obama's best performance of any state in the country. Hawaii native Obama won the state with 73% of the vote, when just 55% of the state voted for Democratic nominee John Kerry in United States presidential election in Hawaii, 2004. Schatz stepped down on January 9, 2010.


== Lieutenant Governor (2010–12) ==


=== 2010 election ===

On January 10, 2010, Schatz announced his candidacy for the office of lieutenant governor. Schatz's campaign priorities included the creation of clean-energy jobs, public education, and technological improvements in the public sector. He also declared his support for Hawaii House Bill 444, which would have allowed same-sex civil unions in Hawaii had it not been vetoed by Republican Governor Linda Lingle. A number of Hawaii labor unions endorsed Schatz for lieutenant governor in the Democratic primary election, held statewide on September 18, 2010.


=== Tenure ===
On December 6, 2010, Schatz was inaugurated as Hawaii's 11th lieutenant governor alongside Neil Abercrombie, who had defeated incumbent Lieutenant Governor Duke Aiona for the governor's seat. Hawaii Supreme Court Associate Justice James Duffy administered the oath of office at the Coronation Pavilion on the grounds of ʻIolani Palace.


== U.S. Senate (2012–present) ==


=== Appointment ===
Shortly before Sen. Daniel Inouye died on December 17, 2012, he dictated a letter to Governor Neil Abercrombie, asking that U.S. Representative Colleen Hanabusa be appointed to finish out his term.
Hawaii law on interim appointments to the U.S. Senate requires the governor to choose from three candidates selected by the party of the previous officeholder. On December 26, 2012, the Hawaii Democratic Party nominated Schatz, Hanabusa, and Esther Kia'aina, the deputy director of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. The same day, Abercrombie named Schatz to the job, despite Inouye's request. Later that night, Schatz accompanied President Barack Obama back to Washington, D.C. on Air Force One. On December 27 Schatz was sworn in as a senator by Vice President Joseph Biden.
Schatz's appointment to Inouye's seat on December 27, 2012 made him the senior senator from Hawaii (Mazie Hirono, who was elected that November to replace retiring Sen. Daniel Akaka, took office just one week later on January 3, 2013). He is only the sixth person to represent Hawaii in the U.S. Senate, and the first non-Asian American to serve since Oren E. Long.


=== 2014 election ===

Schatz announced his intention to run for election in the special election to be held in 2014. In April 2013, Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa announced she would oppose Schatz in the primary. The core of the Schatz campaign was climate change and renewable energy, and fieldwork from the Super-PAC Climate Hawks Vote has been credited with possibly putting Schatz over the top in a close Democratic primary. Schatz defeated Hanabusa by 1,782 votes (0.75 percent) in a primary delayed in two precincts by Hurricane Iselle.
As expected in heavily Democratic Hawaii, Schatz went on to win the general election with about 70% of the vote.

Subcommittee on Defense
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee on Legislative Branch (Ranking Member)

In one of his first votes as senator, he voted against renewing the FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012.


=== Gun laws ===
On April 17, 2013, Schatz voted to expand background checks for gun purchases.


=== Global warming ===
Schatz participated in an overnight talkathon on behalf of climate change while the League of Conservation Voters, a group supporting the talkathon, was running campaign ads on Schatz's behalf. During a debate on the Senate floor, Schatz said, "For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed." Politifact rated this statement as only "half true" since he referred to the ice sheet, rather than the surface ice.


=== Government Surveillance ===
Schatz voted yes to the controversial Cyber Information Sharing Act, a bill that many civil liberties groups oppose. The American Civil Liberties Union refers to CISA as "one of those privacy-shredding bills in cybersecurity clothing." 


=== Other ===
In order to encourage tourism in West Hawaii, Schatz is currently proposing that Customs begins in Japan so that planes can arrive in West Hawaii as domestic flights.


== Personal life ==
Schatz is married to Linda Kwok Kai Yun Schatz and has a son, Tyler, and a daughter, Mia.
Brian's identical twin brother, Steve, runs the Hawaii Department of Education's Office of Strategic Reform.
His father, Dr. Irwin Schatz, in 1964, was the first to publicly identify the injustice of the Tuskegee Study, and remained an influential critic of the study through his life.


== Electoral history ==
Schatz was elected in a separate primary but on a joint ticket in the general election with Neil Abercrombie, who was running for Governor.

** Stricter punishment reduces crime **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: 'Three Strikes' laws put dangerous repeat offenders where they belong - behind bars, for life. And the Death Penalty gets rid of them once and for all. Mandatory sentencing and strict enforcement make sure that judges don't let off criminals too easily. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Keep death penalty and 'Three Strikes' laws on the books because they seem to be effective, but consider ways to deal with special circumstances so we can avoid horror stories of inappropriate imprisonment. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Strict enforcement of pre-determined sentencing threatens civil rights and should be used cautiously. Police, courts and prisons should focus on _effective_ enforcement rather than _strict_ enforcement. The death penalty should be used with extreme caution, if at all. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Judicial discretion should not be diminished by formulaic sentencing like 'Three Strikes.' Let judges and juries decide what penalties to apply in each case. The death penalty should be abolished as "cruel and unusual punishment". 

This question is looking for your views on whether stricter enforcement and
mandatory sentencing is the solution to crime.  However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Stricter penalties reduce all crimes 
  * 'Broken Windows' laws work 
  * Reduce judicial discretion 
  * Equivalent punishment for the taking of a life. 
  * Some people are bad and should be removed from society. 
  * The concept of rehabilitation is not applicable to prison. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of punishment as the purpose of incarceration. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** reasons like reducing judicial discretion. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe in **practical** reforms like sentencing guidelines, but not mandatory ones. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of rehabilitation as the purpose of incarceration.

****BACKGROUND**

**Black Lives Matter**

The 'Black Lives Matter' movement attempts to get police to stop treating
African-Americans differently than white suspects. The movement comes to the
fore whenever a video emerges from a police shooting of black suspects, as has
occurred regularly over the past years. Saying 'Black Lives Matter' blames the
police for institutionalized racism, and demands corrective action by changing
how police behave. The counter-movement uses the term 'Blue Lives Matter,'
implying support of police in a dangerous job.

The National Crime Victimization Survey found the lowest overall crime rate
since the survey began in 1973. Since 1994, violent crime rates have declined,
reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2010. Property crime rates continue
to decline as well.

![](Crime_Victim_Chart.gif)

Despite the falling crime rate, taking into account both violent crime and
property crime, 83 percent of Americans can expect to be a victim of crime at
least once in their lifetime. **Three Strikes Laws**

Three Strikes laws mean that people convicted of a third felony receive a
mandatory life sentence. The term refers to the baseball rule, "Three Strikes
and You're Out." Some candidates advocate Two Strikes or One Strike, which
generally means more mandatory sentencing, less judicial discretion, and less
chance of early parole. **Prison-Industrial Complex**

The opposite viewpoint from Three Strikes focuses on the increasing prison
population. In this view, along with prison privatization, imprisonment has
become big business, and hence subject to political pressure to increase
imprisonment. In particular, black males are ever more likely to be
imprisoned.

![](Crime_Prison_Industrial_Complex.jpg) **Broken Windows Laws**

Broken Windows laws mean that police focus on quality of life issues as much
as on crime itself. By addressing even minor crimes such as broken windows,
according to this theory, a community is less likely to tolerate any crime,
and overall crime rates should fall. **Community Policing**

Community Policing refers to a policy of crime prevention replacing incident
response. It is often accompanied by a broken windows policy, or by increased
police presence on the streets. **Tort Reform**

A tort means a civil infraction as opposed to a criminal violation. Tort
reform includes capping lawsuit rewards; banning frivolous lawsuits; or some
other change in civil lawsuit procedures. **Capital Punishment**

The death penalty is currently implemented in 34 states. It was re-legalized
by a Supreme Court decision in 1977. Since then, 1,278 people have been
executed. About 3,250 inmates remain on 'Death Row.' Texas is by far the
national leader in executions--it has executed 477 people as of Jan. 2012, 37%
of the national total. (Virginia is a very distant second with 109).

Much of the current controversy about the death penalty focuses on the
circumstances where it should be applied, and on its unequal application among
racial and socioeconomic classes. About 52% of death row inmates are Black or
other minority, versus 17% in the general population. Over 98% of death row
inmates are male.

**Hate Crimes**

Congress defines Hate Crimes as a crime in which the defendant intentionally
selects a victim because of the actual or perceived race, color, national
origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation of that person.
Hate Crimes are covered primarily as racial or anti-gay issues under [Civil
Rights](../Background_Civil_Rights.htm).  **Amendments V and VIII to the US
Constitution**

V. No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law.... (1791)  
VIII. Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. (1791)
