John Anthony Barrasso III (born July 21, 1952) is the junior United States Senator from Wyoming and a member of the Republican Party. He was appointed to the Senate in June 2007, following the death of Craig L. Thomas, and won a special election in 2008 to fill the remaining four years of Thomas's term. He was re-elected to a full six-year term in 2012.


== Early life, education, and medical career ==
Barrasso was born in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1952, the son of Louise M. (née DeCisco) and John Anthony Barrasso, Jr. He is of Italian descent. He is a 1970 graduate of the former Central Catholic High School, which, in 2011, combined with Holy Name High School to form Berks Catholic HS, in Reading, PA. Barrasso began his college career at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (where he became a member of Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity) and transferred to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., graduating with a bachelor of science degree in 1974. He also received his M.D. degree from Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1978. He conducted his residency at Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut.
In addition to his private orthopedic practice, Barrasso was Chief of Staff of the Wyoming Medical Center, State President of the Wyoming Medical Society, President of the National Association of Physician Broadcasters, and a member of the American Medical Association Council of Ethics and Judicial Affairs.
Barrasso was also a rodeo physician for the Professional Rodeo Cowboy's Association (and a member of the "Cowboy Joe Club") and volunteered as a team physician for Casper College as well as several local high schools. He has also been awarded the "Wyoming Physician of the Year." He has been awarded the "Medal of Excellence" by the Wyoming National Guard for his services to the National Guard as well. Barrasso also received the "Legislative Service Award" from the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) for his support of Wyoming's veterans. He is a board-certified orthopedic surgeon in private practice in Casper. He is known by many as "Wyoming's Doctor."


== 1996 U.S. Senate election ==

Barrasso ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1996 for the seat being vacated by Republican Alan K. Simpson. Barrasso lost the primary election to State Senator Mike Enzi, 32% to 30%, in a seven-candidate election.

Barrasso was elected to the Wyoming Senate unopposed in 2002 and won re-election unopposed in 2006.
During his time in the State Senate he served as Chairman of the Transportation and Highways Committee.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== Appointment ===
Barrasso was chosen on June 22, 2007, by Democratic Governor Dave Freudenthal to replace Senator Craig L. Thomas, who died earlier in the month. Under state law, Freudenthal was able to consider only three individuals whose names were submitted to him by the Republican State Central Committee because the seat was vacated by a Republican. The others were former State Treasurer Cynthia Lummis of Cheyenne, later Wyoming's only member of the United States House of Representatives, and former Republican State Chairman and lobbyist Tom Sansonetti, a former aide to Thomas. Matt Mead, grandson of former Senator Clifford P. Hansen, had also sought the nomination but was eliminated by the central committee in fourth place. So had the previous gubernatorial nominee from 2006, Ray Hunkins, a Wheatland rancher and lawyer. Mead later went on to be elected Governor of Wyoming in 2010, and Lummis was elected to Congress in 2008. When he was appointed, Barrasso indicated that he would also run in the November 2008 special election to fill the remainder of Thomas' term.


=== Elections ===
2008

Barrasso announced on May 19, 2008, that he would run in the general election in 2008 to serve the remainder of Thomas' term, though he had already stated that intention before his appointment. Tom Sansonetti, one of the three Republican candidates selected for consideration by Freudenthal, said he would not challenge Barrasso in the primary. The other candidate for selection, Cynthia Lummis, was a candidate for the Republican nomination to replace retiring U.S. Representative Barbara Cubin for the state's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The filing deadline in Wyoming was May 30, 2008, and ultimately Barrasso did not face a primary opponent. The Democratic nominee was Nick Carter, a lawyer from Gillette. Pundits unanimously rated the race "Safe Republican." As expected, Barrasso won the general election in a landslide, garnering 73% of the vote.
2012

Barrasso ran for re-election to a first full term in 2012. He faced three opponents for the Republican nomination, which he won with 90% of the vote. In the general election, he faced Democratic nominee Tim Chestnut, a member of the Albany County Board of Commissioners. Barrasso won the election with 76% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
Barrasso was quoted as saying, “I believe in limited government, lower taxes, less spending, traditional family values, local control and a strong national defense,” and said he has “voted for prayer in schools, against gay marriage and [has] sponsored legislation to protect the "sanctity of life".
Barrasso joined Wyoming colleague Mike Enzi in endorsing the nomination of Richard Honaker of Rock Springs to the U.S. District Court in Cheyenne. The nomination was pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2007 until Barack Obama became president.
In 2007, Roll Call called Barrasso the least powerful member of the Senate.


==== Abortion ====
In 1996, Barrasso ran for the U.S. Senate as a pro-choice candidate. During his career in the Wyoming Legislature, he sponsored an unsuccessful bill to treat the killing of a pregnant woman as a double homicide.


==== Gun laws ====
In 2002, he received an "A" rating from the National Rifle Association. According to a Washington Post survey, he has voted with Republicans 94 percent of the time. In April 2013, Barrasso was one of 46 senators to vote against the passing of a bill which would have expanded background checks for all gun buyers. Barrasso voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop the bill.


==== Health care ====
Barrasso voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.


==== Environmentalism ====
Barrasso opposed the CIA's creation of its Center on Climate Change and National Security in 2009. In 2011, Barrasso introduced a bill that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from limiting carbon dioxide emissions.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Stricter punishment reduces crime **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: 'Three Strikes' laws put dangerous repeat offenders where they belong - behind bars, for life. And the Death Penalty gets rid of them once and for all. Mandatory sentencing and strict enforcement make sure that judges don't let off criminals too easily. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Keep death penalty and 'Three Strikes' laws on the books because they seem to be effective, but consider ways to deal with special circumstances so we can avoid horror stories of inappropriate imprisonment. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Strict enforcement of pre-determined sentencing threatens civil rights and should be used cautiously. Police, courts and prisons should focus on _effective_ enforcement rather than _strict_ enforcement. The death penalty should be used with extreme caution, if at all. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Judicial discretion should not be diminished by formulaic sentencing like 'Three Strikes.' Let judges and juries decide what penalties to apply in each case. The death penalty should be abolished as "cruel and unusual punishment". 

This question is looking for your views on whether stricter enforcement and
mandatory sentencing is the solution to crime.  However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Stricter penalties reduce all crimes 
  * 'Broken Windows' laws work 
  * Reduce judicial discretion 
  * Equivalent punishment for the taking of a life. 
  * Some people are bad and should be removed from society. 
  * The concept of rehabilitation is not applicable to prison. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of punishment as the purpose of incarceration. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** reasons like reducing judicial discretion. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe in **practical** reforms like sentencing guidelines, but not mandatory ones. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of rehabilitation as the purpose of incarceration.

****BACKGROUND**

**Black Lives Matter**

The 'Black Lives Matter' movement attempts to get police to stop treating
African-Americans differently than white suspects. The movement comes to the
fore whenever a video emerges from a police shooting of black suspects, as has
occurred regularly over the past years. Saying 'Black Lives Matter' blames the
police for institutionalized racism, and demands corrective action by changing
how police behave. The counter-movement uses the term 'Blue Lives Matter,'
implying support of police in a dangerous job.

The National Crime Victimization Survey found the lowest overall crime rate
since the survey began in 1973. Since 1994, violent crime rates have declined,
reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2010. Property crime rates continue
to decline as well.

![](Crime_Victim_Chart.gif)

Despite the falling crime rate, taking into account both violent crime and
property crime, 83 percent of Americans can expect to be a victim of crime at
least once in their lifetime. **Three Strikes Laws**

Three Strikes laws mean that people convicted of a third felony receive a
mandatory life sentence. The term refers to the baseball rule, "Three Strikes
and You're Out." Some candidates advocate Two Strikes or One Strike, which
generally means more mandatory sentencing, less judicial discretion, and less
chance of early parole. **Prison-Industrial Complex**

The opposite viewpoint from Three Strikes focuses on the increasing prison
population. In this view, along with prison privatization, imprisonment has
become big business, and hence subject to political pressure to increase
imprisonment. In particular, black males are ever more likely to be
imprisoned.

![](Crime_Prison_Industrial_Complex.jpg) **Broken Windows Laws**

Broken Windows laws mean that police focus on quality of life issues as much
as on crime itself. By addressing even minor crimes such as broken windows,
according to this theory, a community is less likely to tolerate any crime,
and overall crime rates should fall. **Community Policing**

Community Policing refers to a policy of crime prevention replacing incident
response. It is often accompanied by a broken windows policy, or by increased
police presence on the streets. **Tort Reform**

A tort means a civil infraction as opposed to a criminal violation. Tort
reform includes capping lawsuit rewards; banning frivolous lawsuits; or some
other change in civil lawsuit procedures. **Capital Punishment**

The death penalty is currently implemented in 34 states. It was re-legalized
by a Supreme Court decision in 1977. Since then, 1,278 people have been
executed. About 3,250 inmates remain on 'Death Row.' Texas is by far the
national leader in executions--it has executed 477 people as of Jan. 2012, 37%
of the national total. (Virginia is a very distant second with 109).

Much of the current controversy about the death penalty focuses on the
circumstances where it should be applied, and on its unequal application among
racial and socioeconomic classes. About 52% of death row inmates are Black or
other minority, versus 17% in the general population. Over 98% of death row
inmates are male.

**Hate Crimes**

Congress defines Hate Crimes as a crime in which the defendant intentionally
selects a victim because of the actual or perceived race, color, national
origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation of that person.
Hate Crimes are covered primarily as racial or anti-gay issues under [Civil
Rights](../Background_Civil_Rights.htm).  **Amendments V and VIII to the US
Constitution**

V. No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law.... (1791)  
VIII. Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. (1791)
