James Stuart "Jim" Gilmore III (born October 6, 1949) is an American politician who was the 68th Governor of Virginia from 1998 to 2002. A native Virginian, Gilmore graduated as a Bachelor of Arts and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia, and then served in the U.S. Army as a counterintelligence agent. He was later elected to public office as a county prosecutor, as the Attorney General of Virginia, and as Governor of Virginia. On July 30, 2015, Gilmore announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States, in the 2016 election. On February 12, 2016, he suspended his campaign.


== Early life and education ==
Gilmore was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Margaret Evelyn (n√©e Kandle), a church secretary, and James Stuart Gilmore, Jr., a grocery store meat cutter. He graduated from John Randolph Tucker High School and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia in 1971.


== Military service ==
Gilmore enlisted in the United States Army after attending college, receiving training and preparation for service in the Military Intelligence Corps at the newly created United States Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca in Arizona. Gilmore also received rigorous foreign language education at the United States Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California. Gilmore then worked for three years in the early 1970s, in the 650th Military Intelligence Group. Serving in West Germany during the Vietnam War and fluent in German, he served as a U.S. Army Counterintelligence Agent.


== Legal career ==
Gilmore graduated from University of Virginia Law School in 1977. Gilmore was elected Commonwealth's Attorney in Henrico County in 1987 and 1991, and then was elected attorney general in 1993. Gilmore resigned in 1997 to run for governor.


== Governor of Virginia ==
In 1997, Gilmore faced then-Lieutenant Governor Don Beyer and Reform Party candidate Sue Harris Debauche in a bid to succeed George Allen as governor. Gilmore campaigned heavily on the twin promises of hiring 4,000 new teachers in public schools and phasing out Virginia's personal property tax on automobiles. Gilmore was elected, winning 56% of the vote to Beyer's 43%.
In his first year as governor, Gilmore pushed for car tax reduction legislation that was eventually passed by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly. The legislation reduced car taxes on all cars valued less than $1,000, and phased out the tax on auto values over $1,000 as follows: 12.5% reduction in 1998; 25% reduction in 1999; 47.5% reduction in 2000; 70% reduction in 2001; 100% reduction in 2002. Beginning in 2001, Virginia's economy slowed and tax revenues flattened. In addition to a downturn in the national economy in 2001, Northern Virginia's economy was severely impacted after terrorists flew a hijacked airplane into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on September 11, 2001, resulting in the closure of Reagan National Airport for several months. Despite the economic downturn, Gilmore insisted on advancing the car tax phase out from a 47.5% reduction of each taxpayer's bill in 2000 to the scheduled 70% reduction in 2001. Gilmore signed an executive order, which was passed by Congress, reducing state spending by all agencies, except for education, to keep the state's budget balanced during the economic downturn. Democrats criticized the spending reductions and car tax cut. According to the Washington Post, "Virginia's politicians struggled to balance car-tax relief against demands for public services." When Gilmore left office in January 2002, the state's "rainy day fund," or revenue stabilization fund, had fallen to $900 million.
Gilmore also implemented new Standards of Learning reforms in Virginia's public schools. The Standards of Learning prescribed a uniform curriculum in mathematics, science, English and social studies and instituted new tests at the end of the third, fifth and eighth grades, as well as end-of-course tests in high school, to measure student achievement. During Gilmore's term, Virginia's public school students' scores increased on these state tests as well as nationally normed tests.
In 1999, Gilmore proposed and signed into law legislation that reduced tuitions at public colleges and universities by 20%. Gilmore also commissioned a Blue Ribbon Commission on Higher Education that studied accountability and governance of public colleges and universities. Gilmore's Commission authored the first blueprint for decentralized regulatory and administrative authority to some universities in return for agreements to meet agreed upon performance objectives.
Gilmore also proposed and signed into law Virginia's first stand-alone Martin Luther King Holiday. Prior to this proposal, Virginia had observed a combined Lee-Jackson-King Day that recognized Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Martin Luther King on the same day each year. Gilmore and his wife hosted a historic reception in the Governor's Mansion for Coretta Scott King and announced a technology partnership between Virginia and the King Center for Nonviolence. Gilmore also proposed and funded a new African-American History Trail in Virginia and called upon the State Board of Education to include a more diverse range of historical figures in Virginia's Social Studies curriculum. Test scores during Gilmore's term showed a narrowing of the "achievement gap" between minority and white students. Gilmore significantly increased funding for two of Virginia's historically black universities, Norfolk State University and Virginia State University.
Gilmore created the nation's first state Secretary of Technology, a position first held by Donald Upson. Together they established a statewide technology commission, and signed into law the nation's first comprehensive state Internet policy.
During his term, 37 people were executed in Virginia. Gilmore granted executive clemency to one death row inmate on the basis of mental illness. In another well publicized case, he pardoned Earl Washington, a former death row inmate, after DNA tests, ordered by Gilmore, implicated another person. Gilmore also ordered DNA tests in the case of Derek Rocco Barnabei; the tests confirmed Barnabei's guilt and he was executed.
As governor, Gilmore signed into law legislation establishing a 24-hour waiting period and informed consent for women seeking an abortion, as well as a ban against partial birth abortion. Gilmore increased funding for adoption services. He also signed into law a bill that banned human cloning. In 1998, Gilmore went to court to try to prevent the removal of a feeding tube of coma victim Hugh Finn. Gilmore argued that removal of a feeding tube was not removal of artificial life support because it amounted to starvation of an infirm person who could not feed himself. As Attorney General of Virginia, Gilmore had defended a legal challenge to Virginia's first parental notification law for minors seeking abortions.
The Virginia Constitution forbids any governor from serving consecutive terms, so Gilmore could not run for a second term in 2001. He was succeeded by Democrat Mark Warner, who took office in early 2002.


== Subsequent positions ==

During his term as governor, Gilmore chaired the Congressional Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. The Commission was charged with the task of making recommendations to the United States Congress on Internet taxation. The Commission's Report to Congress opposed taxation of the Internet.
From 1999 to 2003, Gilmore chaired the Congressional Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, nicknamed the Gilmore Commission. It presented five reports to Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and to Congress each December 15 from 1999 through 2003.
From January 2001 to January 2002, Gilmore was the Chairman of the Republican National Committee.


== 2008 presidential candidacy ==

A "Draft Gilmore for President" group was formed in August 2006 encouraging Gilmore to run for President of the United States. On December 19, 2006, Gilmore announced he would form an exploratory committee to "fill the conservative void" in the race. On January 9, 2007, Gilmore officially filed papers with the Federal Election Commission to form the Jim Gilmore for President Exploratory Committee.
Gilmore said he represented "the Republican wing of the Republican Party" in the race for the 2008 Presidential nomination; the comment mirrored the slogan used by Howard Dean when seeking the Democratic nomination in the 2004 election, who lifted the slogan from Senator Paul Wellstone. Gilmore officially announced his candidacy on April 26, 2007.
In the first quarter of 2007 Gilmore raised $174,790, the second lowest of any of the major-party candidates. Gilmore hosted only one fundraiser in the first quarter due to a late exploratory announcement.
On July 14, 2007, Gilmore announced that he was ending his campaign. Gilmore said that it would be "impractical" to run, citing the difficulty of raising enough money to be competitive in early-voting states Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.


== 2008 Senate campaign ==

In an interview with Politico, Gilmore said that he had been approached to run for the Senate seat of John Warner, who announced his retirement for his senate term ending in 2009. By the end of the summer, many media outlets, most notably the Washington Post, thought it would be a foregone conclusion that Gilmore would jump into the Senate race. Gilmore's successor as governor, Mark Warner, had already announced in September, and 11th District Congressman Tom Davis had informally announced his candidacy a few days after Mark Warner's announcement.
Gilmore lobbied strongly for choosing the party's nominee at a statewide convention rather than a primary, claiming that a convention would cost only $1 million versus the $4 million required to run a primary campaign. This was no small consideration, as the race for the Democratic nomination essentially ended with Mark Warner's entry into the race. It was understood that Warner would use his considerable wealth to self-finance his campaign. It was thought that a convention would favor Gilmore, since most of the delegates would come from the party's activist base, which is tilted strongly to the right. A primary was thought to favor Davis due to his popularity in voter-rich Northern Virginia; Davis is a moderate Republican, and most Republicans in Northern Virginia tend to be more moderate than their counterparts elsewhere in the state. On October 13, 2007 the state party's central committee voted 47‚Äì37 to hold a convention rather than a primary. With this decision, Gilmore said he was seriously considering a run for the Senate.
Gilmore formally announced his candidacy via a YouTube video on November 19, 2007. He said that he was running to give Virginia "a strong and steady hand" in the Senate. The domain name jimgilmoreforsenate.com had been registered on July 10 ‚Äì four months before Gilmore's formal entry ‚Äì and the username that uploaded the video to YouTube had been registered on October 16.
Gilmore faced a challenge from his right in State Delegate Bob Marshall of Prince William County. Marshall charged Gilmore with being too soft on abortion. However, at the convention Gilmore won the nomination by only 65 votes out of 3,000 cast.
In the November election, Gilmore was defeated, winning only 34 percent of the vote to Warner's 65 percent. Gilmore only carried four counties in the state ‚Äì Rockingham, Augusta, Powhatan and Hanover. In many cases, he lost in many areas of the state that are normally reliably Republican.


== 2016 presidential candidacy ==

On July 7, 2015, Gilmore told the Associated Press that he planned to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination in the first week of August 2015. On July 29, Gilmore filed his candidacy for President of the United States with the Federal Election Commission. He announced his candidacy via an internet video clip the next day.
According to his campaign website, Gilmore's main issues that he would address if elected President include preserving the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, immigration and border re-enforcement, healthcare reform, and restoring America's economy. Gilmore struggled to gain any traction in the 2016 presidential race, and has been little known among voters, being excluded from most of the debates.
In the 2016 Iowa Republican caucuses, Gilmore received 12 votes, not earning him any delegates. He then received 133 votes in the New Hampshire primary. On February 12, Gilmore suspended his campaign.


== Personal life ==
Gilmore is the President & CEO of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank which was founded by Paul Weyrich.
Gilmore has also served as Chairman of the National Council on Readiness & Preparedness, a homeland security program focused on community involvement and public/private partnerships. He is also President of USA Secure, a non-profit homeland security think tank based in Washington, D.C.
He is also on the Board of Directors of the National Rifle Association.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Make voter registration easier **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support ** means you believe: 
  * Voter ID laws are racist and intended to suppress minority voting. 
  * More enforcement of right to vote, not enforcement against voters. 
  * Public funds should be used for political campaigns. 
  * The best way to reduce the influence of big-money lobbyists and special interests is to remove as much money as possible from campaigning. Free television time would be a good start. 
  * **Support** means you believe: 
  * Voter ID laws just make it harder for people to vote, and we should work to make it EASIER to vote. 
  * Reforms are needed in campaign finance, in order to reduce the influence of moneyed interests. 
  * Those reforms might include restrictions on personal donations to political campaigns; restrictions on corporate, labor union, or PAC donations; and restrictions on PAC activities. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: 
  * ID requirements for voting are reasonable. 
  * Politicians will always find loopholes in any campaign finance reform, so the best approach is just to monitor campaigns for lawbreaking and leave the rest to the press. Better reporting of donations would be useful. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: 
  * Voter fraud undermines the most fundamental process of democracy, and we need to fight it. 
  * Campaign donations are free speech, and should not be limited for corporations nor for individuals. PACs and 527 committees should be similarly allowed free speech via unlimited spending on any issue or any candidate they choose. 

This question is looking for your views on whether wealthy individuals should
have an unlimited right to finance political candidates (including
themselves). However you answer the above question would be similar to your
response to these statements:

  * Require TV networks to provide free air time to candidates 
  * Stricter limits on political campaign funds 
  * Voter ID laws are racist 
  * Suppressing the vote is incumbency protection 
  * Overturn _Citizens United_ via a Constitutional Amendment 
  * Include a checkoff box on tax returns for optional $1 contributions 
  * Support "Clean Election" laws where candidates receive funding if they agree to spending limits 
  * Restrict PAC (political action committees) spending on individual campaigns. 
  * Restrict the activities of 527 committees (independent fundraising entities such as MoveOn.org or the Swift Boat Veterans committee) 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of taxpayer funding for political campaigns. 
  * **Support** means you believe that restrictions on campaign finance, and/or partial public funding, is a **practical** means to reduce undue political influence. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe some **practical** reforms are needed, but that the basic system of privately financing political campaigns is acceptable. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that the **principle** of free speech applies to political campaign donations. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

**Campaign Finance Reform**
  * "McCain-Feingold" refers to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as BCRA, named after its sponsors, Sen. John McCain (R, AZ) and Sen. Russ Feingold (D, WI). McCain-Feingold doubled the campaign donation limit from $1,000 per person to $2,000 per person ($2,500 in 2012), known as "hard money." The law banned "soft money" contributions to political parties, but later Supreme Court cases, particularly "Citizens United," allowed unlimited soft money for purposes of advertising for or against a candidate as long as there was no "coordination" with the campaign. 

  * Citizens United refers to a 2010 Supreme Court case which allowed unlimited spending by Super-PACs on behalf of any candidate, as long as the TV ads are not coordinated with the campaign itself. Super-PACs dominate the spending in the 2012 presidential primaries. 

  * PAC money means donations to political action committees, which is used for issue ads which typically favor one candidate, but do not count in federal spending limits. 

  * Soft money means donations to the national party rather than to a particular candidate ($193 million in the 1998 election, for example). 

  * Hard money is subject to less reform proposals -- it means cash donations to a particular candidate, which must be fully reported to the FEC. 

  * Individuals may donate a maximum of $1000 to one candidate, but may donate any amount of soft money, and any amount to PACs. 

  * Candidates who volutarily limit their campaign spending qualify for federal matching funds of about $100 million. 

**Earmarks**
  * Earmark Reform" refers to changing the rules of Congress to restrict earmarks," which are currently legal and ethical. 

  * Earmarks" means line items in legislative bills which allocate specific monetary resources to a specific purpose (or to a specific company). 

  * An example is a highway improvement project in a House member's district, buried in a 1,000-page spending bill. 

  * Earmarks have become controversial because, in theory, members of Congress could quietly allocate an earmark that would benefit a campaign donor (known as pork-barrel spending"). 

  * Proposed reforms range from full disclosure (showing every earmark and its originating legislator on a public website) to the Line Item Veto (allowing the President to veto earmarks without vetoing the entire spending bill). 

**Czars**
  * The term "czar" refers to a powerful presidential appointee who is not confirmed by the Senate. In other words, a "czar" is answerable only to the President, unlike normal Cabinet secretaries and other appointees, who must pass the Senate confirmation process. 

  * "Czar" is an informal title used by the press and sometimes by the appointee. For example, [Elizabeth Warren](../Senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm) was known as the "Consumer Czar," but her formal title was "Special Advisor for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau." 

  * Czars were popularized by Pres. Clinton and the czar count increased to several dozen under Pres. George W. Bush and Pres. Obama, but the practice goes back to the 1930s. 

**Term Limits**
  * The Constitution limits the president to two terms, or a total of 10 years. There are not limits for the US House or the US Senate. 

  * In March 1998, the Supreme Court let stand term limits for state lawmakers, but previously ruled that establishing such restrictions nationally would require amending the Constitution. Efforts to limit federal Congressional terms died out in early 1997. 

  * 18 states have laws limiting politicians' terms, and in 1998, more than 200 state legislators were forced to retire. 

  * The latest push is for term limits for judges. The purpose would be to limit Judicial activism, which means establishing new laws from the bench rather than from Congress. 

**Balanced Budget Amendment**
  * In 1998, the Senate defeated by one vote a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the Constitution. It would have mandated an end to deficit spending unless 60% of Congress voted to override. 
  * State budget balancing requirements typically only apply to the _operating budget_ (ongoing expenses), but not to _capital expenditures_ (one-time investments). The proposed BBA restricts both. 
  * The Line Item Veto would be another Constitutional Amendment intended to reduce budget growth, by allowing the President to selectively veto particular spending items. 
  * Corporate welfare restrictions are often addressed in the context of a BBA or Line Item Veto. However, most federal corporate subsidies are embedded in the tax code rather than in the spending side of the budget. 

**Devolution to States**
  * Unfunded Mandates mean that the federal government requires states to undertake activities without providing funding for them. 
  * Block Grants mean that the federal government gives states funds to spend as each state sees fit. 
  * Devolution means the federal government should close departments and agencies, transfer functions to the states, or otherwise yield control over policy which is now federally controlled. The philosophy behind devolving power to the states is based in the 10th Amendment. It is currently appiled primarily to welfare reform. 

**Reinventing Government**
  * Reinvention has been the official policy of the federal government since 1993. The basic concepts are: 
  * Government should steer rather than row (provide a framework for non-government action rather than operate institutions). 
  * Government should focus on outcomes (desired results) and needs of customers (service recipients), rather than inputs (dollars and jobs) and needs of bureaucracies (rules). 
  * Government should decentralize and address problems from the lowest level of government possible; 
  * Public agencies should compete with private agencies, and should adopt a market orientation; 
  * Government which work betters also costs less. 

**Election Reform**
  * The GOP proposed a plan in May 2000, that small states would have primaries first, progressing to larger states over a four-month primary season. 
  * An older proposal is a system of regional primaries with a rotating right to go first. 
  * A constitutional amendment would be required to modify the Electoral College, but not to modify the primaries; many states in 2012 switched their GOP primaries from ['Winner-take-all' to 'Proportional'](../2012_WTA_vs_Proportional.htm).  

**Amendment X to the US Constitution** The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. (1791)
