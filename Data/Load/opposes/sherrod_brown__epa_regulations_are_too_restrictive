Sherrod Campbell Brown (born November 9, 1952) is the senior United States Senator from Ohio, in office since January 3, 2007. Brown is a member of the Democratic Party. Before his election to the Senate, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Ohio's 13th congressional district from 1993 to 2007. He previously served as the Ohio Secretary of State (1983–1991) and as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives (1974–1982).
Brown defeated two-term Republican incumbent Mike DeWine in the 2006 Senate election and was re-elected in 2012, defeating state Treasurer Josh Mandel. In the Senate, he was chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Hunger, Nutrition and Family Farms and the Banking Subcommittee on Economic Policy, and is also a member of the Committee on Finance, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and Select Committee on Ethics. Beginning January 2015, Brown became the Ranking Democratic Member on the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.


== Early life, education, and academic career ==
Brown was born in Mansfield, Ohio, the son of Emily (née Campbell) and Charles Gailey Brown, M.D. He was named after his maternal grandfather. He became an Eagle Scout in 1967. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian studies from Yale University in 1974. At Yale, he lived in Davenport College. He went on to receive a Master of Public Administration degree and a Master of Arts degree in education from Ohio State University in Columbus in 1979 and 1981, respectively. He taught at the Mansfield branch campus of Ohio State University from 1979 to 1981. He backpacked in India during the Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.


== Early political career ==
Brown served as a state representative in Ohio from 1974 to 1982. At the time of his election to the Ohio House, he was the youngest person elected to that body. In 1982, he won a four-way Democratic primary that included Dennis Kucinich. He then defeated Republican Virgil Brown in the general election for the office of Ohio Secretary of State, succeeding Anthony J. Celebrezze, Jr. In 1986, Brown won, defeating Vincent C. Campanella. In 1990, Brown lost his run for a third term to Republican Bob Taft.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===

In 1992, Brown moved from Mansfield to Lorain, Ohio, and won a heavily contested Democratic primary for the open seat for Ohio's 13th district, located in the western and southern suburbs of Cleveland, after eight-term incumbent Don Pease announced his retirement. The Democratic-leaning district gave him an easy win over the little-known Republican Margaret R. Mueller. He was re-elected six times.


=== Tenure ===
In 2001, the Republican-controlled legislature considered redrawing Brown's district. Some top Democrats urged Brown to relocate and take on fellow Democrat James Traficant after he defected when he voted to elect Republican Dennis Hastert as speaker of the U.S. House.
In 2005, Brown led the Democratic effort to block the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). For many months, Brown worked as whip on the issue, securing Democratic "nay" votes and seeking Republican allies. After several delays, the House of Representatives finally voted on CAFTA after midnight on July 28, 2005, which ended in passage by one vote.
He opposed an amendment to Ohio's constitution that banned same-sex marriage. Brown was also one of the few U.S. Representatives to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996.


=== Committee assignments ===
Brown was the ranking minority member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee. He also served on the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection. While serving on the House International Relations Committee, he was also a member of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. He was also a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== Issues ===


==== Bank and finance industry consolidation ====
In February 2013, conservative commentator George F. Will wrote in support of Brown's proposal to break up consolidated banks and finance industry conglomerates, ending "too big to fail" by restoring the Glass-Steagall Act.


==== Foreign policy ====
Brown opposed the Iraq War and voted against the Iraq Resolution as a House Representative. He voted against the $87 billion war budgetary supplement. He also voted for redeploying US troops out of Iraq by March 2008.
In 2008, Brown joined 91 other senators in voting for the Iraq and Afghanistan War Funding, Unemployment Benefits Extension, and GI Bill, which required the Department of Defense to provide a timetable for achieving security in Iraq, provided education funding for veterans, extended unemployment compensation, and appropriated funds to combat drug trafficking, reduce Medicaid fraud, assist victims of natural disasters, and fund the Department of Defense.
In 2012, he co-sponsored a resolution to "oppose any policy that would rely on containment as an option in response to the Iranian nuclear threat.", and voted in favor of the 2012 NDAA that sparked controversy over indefinite detention of US citizens.
On May 13, 2014, Brown introduced the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2014 (S. 2323; 113th Congress), a bill that would expand preferred eligibility for federal jobs to the fathers of certain permanently disabled or deceased veterans. Brown said that "when a service member is killed in action or permanently and totally disabled, the government should do its part to be there for grieving parents - no matter if they're fathers or mothers."


==== LGBT rights ====
Brown is an advocate of equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. He also voted against prohibiting same-sex couples from adopting children in Washington D.C., and received a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign. On November 30, 2010 Brown made a contribution to the It Gets Better Project from the Senate floor, and on December 18, 2010 he voted in favor of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010.


==== Health care ====
In 2007 Brown and Sam Brownback (R-KS) sponsored an amendment to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. President George W. Bush signed the bill in September 2007. The amendment established a prize as an incentive for companies to invest in new drugs and vaccines for neglected tropical diseases. It awards a transferable “Priority Review Voucher” to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for a neglected tropical disease. This provision adds to the market based incentives available for the development of new medicines for developing world diseases in the developing world, among them malaria, tuberculosis and African sleeping sickness. The prize had been proposed by Duke University faculty members Henry Grabowski, Jeffrey Moe, and David Ridley in their 2006 Health Affairs paper "Developing Drugs for Developing Countries."
Brown supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, voting for it in December 2009, and he voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.


==== Ideology ====
In 2011, in the National Journal’s annual rankings, Brown tied with eight other members for the title of the most liberal member of Congress.


==== Intellectual property ====
Brown was a cosponsor of the Protect-IP Act (PIPA).


==== Stimulus spending ====
In 2009 when the vote on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act came down to just a few votes, Brown (an ardent advocate of the legislation) was attending services for his deceased mother. The White House provided a plane in order to fly him back to vote for the bill when it was determined that no commercial flight would make it on time. "Although most senators voted shortly after 5:30 p.m., the 60th and final vote was not cast until 10:46 p.m. by Sen. Sherrod Brown."


==== Trade ====
Brown has criticized free trade with China and other countries. In a 2006 Washington Post article, Brown argued against free trade on the grounds that labor activism was responsible for the growth of the U.S. middle class, and that the U.S. economy is harmed by trade relations with countries that lack the kind of labor regulations that have resulted from that activism.
In 2011, the Columbus Dispatch noted that Brown "loves to rail against international trade agreements." Brown's book, Myths of Free Trade, argues that "an unregulated global economy is a threat to all of us." He recommends adopting measures that would allow for emergency tariffs, protect Buy America laws, including those that give preference to minority and women-owned businesses, and hold foreign producers to American labor and environmental standards.
Brown was the co-author and sponsor of a bill that would officially declare China a currency manipulator and require the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties on Chinese imports.


=== Elections ===
2006

In August 2005, Brown announced he would not run for the United States Senate seat held by Republican Mike DeWine. In October, however, Brown reconsidered his decision. His announcement came shortly after Democrat Paul Hackett stated that he would soon announce his candidacy.
On February 13, 2006, Hackett withdrew from the race, all but ensuring that Brown would win the Democratic nomination. In the May 2 primary, Brown won 78.05% of the Democratic vote. His opponent, Merrill Samuel Keiser, Jr., received 21.95% of the vote.
In the middle of his Senate campaign in April 2006, Brown, along with John Conyers, brought an action against George W. Bush and others, alleging violations of the Constitution in the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The case, Conyers v. Bush, was ultimately dismissed for lack of standing.
On November 7, 2006, Brown faced two-term incumbent senator Mike DeWine in the general election. Brown won the seat with 56% of the vote to DeWine's 44%.
2012

Brown stood for reelection in 2012, defeating opponent Josh Mandel, who in 2010 defeated the incumbent state treasurer by 14 points. Mandel raised $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 alone, to Brown’s $1.5 million. Early on, Brown enjoyed a steady lead in the polls. Mandel won the March Republican primary with 63% of the vote.
The Washington Post reported that no candidate running for reelection, save Barack Obama, faced more opposition in 2012 by outside groups. As of April 2012, over $5.1 million had been spent on television ads opposing Brown, according to data provided by a Senate Democratic campaign operative. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent $2.7 million. 60 Plus Association, a conservative group that opposes health care reform, spent another $1.4 million. Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS and the Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee have also spent heavily in the race. In May 2012, Brown hit the campaign trail with West Wing actor Martin Sheen.


=== Controversial remarks ===
In March 2011, Brown came under scrutiny for a senate floor speech in which he cited the names of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin while he criticized Republican efforts in Ohio and Wisconsin to mitigate the power of public employee unions to negotiate with taxpayers. In his speech he said "some of the worst governments that we've ever had, do you know one of the first things they did? They went after unions. Hitler didn't want unions, Stalin didn't want unions, Mubarak didn't want independent unions". Brown, however, added that he was not comparing the two situations. He later apologized for his speech.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** EPA regulations are too restrictive **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: The earth is humankind's domain to do with as we see fit. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Human needs come first, but it's ok to account for environmental needs after human needs are accounted for. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: We should balance animal rights with human needs, accounting for nature's value for humans as well as for other environmental benefits. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Animals have inherent rights, and nature has inherent value. 

This question is looking for your views on environmentalism both under
economic terms and " under the 5th Amendment.  However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * No 'rights' to clean air and water 
  * "Sustainability" is a codeword for "Socialism" 
  * In Gen.1:26, God promised Man dominion over the earth and all its resources. 
  * The "takings clause" of the Constitution prohibits eminent domain for most reasons. 
  * You cannot sue a company for polluting 
  * Wise Use 
  * Human needs over animal rights 
  * There's plenty of room for animals; right next to the mashed potatoes on my plate. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you oppose the **principle** of environmentalism, and you believe in the **principle** of placing human needs first. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** methods of natural resource use. You prioritize people first, but goals can be accomplished with respect for nature. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe **practical** compromise between economic needs and environmental needs. You might cite that Gen.1:26 properly uses the term "stewardship," implying caretaker status, rather than "dominion," implying ownership status. You cite "sustainability" as the rationale for environmental action; and recognize that hunters and anglers are your potential allies. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of animal rights and the **principle** of the value of nature for its own sake. You support vegetarianism; take pride in the title of "tree-hugger"; and abhor hunting. You cite morality (rather than sustainability) as the rationale for environmental action. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

**Environment and Energy**   
Energy issues have so dominated the 2012 election that all other environmental
issues have fallen aside. In fact, the term "environmental issues" in this
election cycle has come to mean "energy issues." In this section, we stick to
non-energy environmental issues -- see our [Energy & Oil](Energy_+_Oil.htm)
section for the energy-based issues. Some hot topics in the 2012 election
cycle:

  * **_Yucca Mountain:**_ A federally-owned mountain in Nevada which the federal government has proposed as a long-term repository for nuclear waste. Yucca Mountain was selected because, in theory, it is geologically stable enough to survive intact for the tens of thousands of years until the nuclear waste becomes harmless. The site was first proposed under President Reagan in 1985-1987; Congress approved it under President Bush in 2002; and then Congress canceled the program under President Obama in April 2011. 

  * **_Big Dig:**_ The "Big Dig" refers to Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project, conducted in large part while Mitt ROmney was governor of Massachusetts. The Big Dig converted an elevated highway, I-93, into a 3.5 mile tunnel through central Boston, and added a third tunnel under Boston Harbor to Logan Airport. The original cost of the project in 1998 was proposed at $3 billion; it grew into a $22 billion project by the latest 2012 estimate. In addition to several construction deaths, a motorist was killed when a section of ceiling collapsed in 2006, attributed to inappropriate glue to hold up the concrete ceiling. The project was also plagued by water leaks for several years, attributed to failure to meet contract specifications. 

  * **_Conservation Easements:**_ Refers to land deeds which restrict future usage of the parcel of land to protect habitat, ban hunting or logging, or otherwise meet conservation goals. Also known as "Land Trusts," they have been tremendously successful in preserving open space and wildlife habitat. To assure that open space and habitat will be there for future generations, Congress provided targeted income tax relief to small farmers and ranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified conservation easement. 

  * **_Green Jobs:**_ "Green Jobs" refers to subsidizing environmentally-friendly industries, usually alternative energy. 

Every recent president, including Obama, has promised "green jobs" in their
State of the Union speeches; but the only action so far has been to mention it
again in the subsequent year's State of the Union message.

"Solyndra" has become shorthand for "cronyism in the name of green jobs."
Solyndra declared bankruptcy in Sept. 2011 after receiving a $527 million
federal loan to support commercial-scale manufacturing for its solar
photovoltaic panels. Romney visited the abandoned Solyndra factory in May 2012
to criticize Obama's policy.  
**Endangered Species**
  * **_Endangered Species Act (ESA):**_ 1973 law prohibiting activities that harm endangered plants or animals or their habitats. Which species are threatened & endangered are listed or delisted by the Secretaries of Interior & Commerce. The controversy comes from limitations on private property to protect one species. 

  * **_Takings:**_ The federal government is allowed to take private property when it serves the public interest (via eminent domain) but must pay fair market value. When the ESA regulates private property use (such as disallowing development), the value is decreased even though the property is not fully taken. The takings controversy concerns how much the government should pay to property owners when their property is only partially taken. 
**Pollution Control vs. Cost Control**
  * **_The Clean Air Act:**_ (CAA) regulates industrial smokestacks and other sources of smog, acid rain, and other air pollutants. The CAA uses numerous market incentives, including pollution permits that are traded on open markets, to minimize costs. 

  * **_The Clean Water Act:**_ (CWA) regulates point-source (sewage pipes) and non-point-source (land and road runoff) water pollution. The EPAs approach since the early 1990s is watershed-based, which means cooperating across political boundaries. 

  * **_CAFE standard:**_ The Corporate Average Fuel Economy requires that all automobile manufacturers maintain an average of 28 miles per gallon (mpg) for all vehicles sold. 

  * **_Command-and-control:**_ Standardized regulations with central enforcement (usually by EPA), as opposed to market-based incentives. 
**Federal Lands**   
The federal government owns 27% of all US land (more than the combined area of
Alaska, Texas, & California).

  1. **_BLM:**_ The Bureau of Land Management owns 270 million acres of cattle grazing land. 
  2. **_USFS:**_ The US Forest Service owns 185 million acres of timber land. 
  3. **_FWS:**_ The Fish & Wildlife Service owns 90 million acres of waterways and surrounding lands. 
  4. **_NPS:**_ The National Park Service owns 75 million acres of national parks and national rivers. 
  5. **_States:**_ State and local governments own 200 million acres of land (another 9% of total US land area). 
**Land Use Buzzwords**
  * **_Devolution:**_ Some candidates believe that land use decisions should devolve from the federal government to state or local government, to encourage community involvement. 
  * **_Wise Use:**_ A code word which means stop federal land use restrictions. It comes from the Forest Services founding doctrines, which say that wise land use includes commercial use plus recreational use. 
  * **_Land Trusts:**_ Privately-held land which has restrictions on development (e.g., wildlife sanctuaries). 
  * **_Suburban Sprawl:**_ Uncontrolled development that fosters automobile usage rather than mass transit. 
  * **_Urban Redevelopment:**_ Restoring inner-city blighted communities via empowerment zones, etc. 
  * **_Brownfields:**_ Locating industrial development on former waste sites (versus wide-open greenfields). 
  * **_Superfund:**_ EPA cleanup of toxic waste sites. 

> **Amendment V to the US Constitution**  
> ...nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation.(1791)
