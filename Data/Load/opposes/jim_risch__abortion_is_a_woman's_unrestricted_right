James Elroy "Jim" Risch (born May 3, 1943) is an American Republican politician, rancher, and attorney from Ada County, Idaho, currently serving as the junior United States Senator from Idaho. He previously served as the 39th and 41st Lieutenant Governor (2003–2006, 2007–2009) and the 31st Governor (2006–2007) of Idaho.


== Early life ==
Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Risch is the son of Helen B. (née Levi) and Elroy A. Risch, a lineman for the local telephone company. His father was of German descent, and his mother was of Irish, Scottish, and English ancestry. Risch attended the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee from 1961 to 1963, then transferred to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He obtained his B.S. in Forestry in 1965, and continued his education at the university's College of Law, serving on Law Review and the College of Law Advisory Committee, receiving his J.D. in 1968.
Risch entered politics in 1970 in Boise at age 27, winning election as Ada County prosecuting attorney. While serving in this capacity, he taught undergraduate classes in criminal justice at Boise State College and served as the president of the state's prosecuting attorneys association.


== State politics ==


=== Idaho Senate ===
Risch was first elected to the Idaho Senate from Ada County in 1974. He entered the state senate leadership in 1976, serving as Majority Leader and later as President Pro Tempore. During his first senatorial term, Risch earned the reputation of being a "bully" due to his efforts to pressure more junior members to vote with him.
In a dramatic upset, Risch was defeated for reelection in 1988 by Democratic political newcomer and Boise attorney Mike Burkett. As of mid-2006, it remains Idaho's most expensive legislative contest.
In the second political defeat of his career, Risch lost the 1994 primary election for a state senate seat to Roger Madsen. Risch returned to the state senate in 1995, as an appointee of Governor Phil Batt, who had named Madsen as the state commerce department's director.


=== First term as Lieutenant Governor ===
In January 2001, Risch had his eye on the lieutenant governor's seat vacated by "Butch" Otter, who resigned to take his elected seat in Congress. However, Governor Dirk Kempthorne appointed state senator Jack Riggs of Coeur d'Alene to the post instead. The following year Risch defeated Riggs in the Republican primary and won the general election, spending $360,000 of his own money to win the $27,000 a year, part-time post.


=== Governor ===
On May 26, 2006, Risch became Governor of Idaho when Kempthorne resigned to become the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Risch served out the remaining seven months of Kempthorne's term, which ended in January 2007.
In August 2006, Risch called a special session of the Idaho Legislature to consider his proposed property tax reform bill, entitled the Property Tax Relief Act of 2006.


=== Second term as Lieutenant Governor ===
Risch was expected to enter the 2006 Republican gubernatorial primary to succeed Kempthorne, who was completing his second term at this time of his federal appointment. However, U.S. Congressman Otter had announced his candidacy for the position in December 2004, and had gained a significant headstart in campaigning and fundraising. In November 2005, Risch announced his intention to seek election again as lieutenant governor.
Risch was unopposed for the 2006 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor and defeated former Democratic U.S. congressman Larry LaRocco in the general election. Risch's term as governor ended in January 2007 and he returned to the role of lieutenant governor. Risch resigned as lieutenant governor to take his seat in the Senate on January 3, 2009. Governor Otter named state Senator Brad Little of Emmett as Risch's replacement.

=== Elections ===
2008

On August 31, 2007, the Associated Press reported that Risch could possibly be appointed United States Senator by Governor Butch Otter to succeed the embattled Larry Craig. The Idaho Statesman reported on September 1, however, that Otter's spokesman denied Risch had been selected and that the governor "has made no decision and he is not leaning toward anybody." On October 9, Risch announced that he would run for the now open Senate seat. In May 2008, Risch was selected as the Republican nominee for Craig's open seat in the U.S. Senate. He defeated Larry LaRocco, a former Democratic congressman, with 58% of the vote. Risch defeated LaRocco in two previous elections: for a state Senate seat in 1986 and for lieutenant governor in 2006.
2014

Risch won re-election to a second term in 2014. Senate candidate Nels Mitchell criticized Risch for not working with Democrats on issues in order to get legislation passed.


=== Tenure ===
Risch was one of four freshmen Republican Senators in the 111th Congress of 2009, with Mike Johanns of Nebraska, George LeMieux of Florida and Scott Brown of Massachusetts.
Republican Senator Mike Crapo praised Risch as "results-oriented".
As a senator, he supported hiding the knowledge that the CIA had tortured people as detailed in the Senate CIA Report on Torture.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Abortion is a woman's unrestricted right **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe: Abortion is a private decision between a woman and her doctor. You believe in the `Right to Choose' and are strongly pro-choice. The right to abortion empowers women and is an important part of women's health rights and women's reproductive freedom. That right includes the right to a government subsidy for poor women who want an abortion. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Restricting `Partial-Birth Abortions' or other specific procedures is reasonable, but clinic access should be unfettered, since other women may choose differently than you. You are pro-choice, but believe that some restrictions are acceptable. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: The fetus is a human being who has rights independent of its mother's rights. You are "pro-life." While abortion under certain circumstances might be tolerated, the basic rights belong to the fetus, not the mother. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Abortion is immoral because it kills a human being, and should never be tolerated. `Roe v. Wade' should be overturned and we should protest abortion clinics as other forms of injustice are protested. 

This question is looking for your views on abortion rights in general.
However you answer the above question would be similar to your response to
these statements:

  * Uphold Roe v. Wade 
  * No Litmus Test for nominees 
  * Enforce Clinic Access laws 
  * Oppose Strict Constructionist judges 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of the right to choose. 
  * **Support** means you believe that abortions will occur anyway so we should make them safe for **practical** reasons. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe more **practical** limitations are appropriate to make abortions rarer. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that abortion violates the **principle** of taking a fetus' life. 

**BACKGROUND**

### Basic terminology of the abortion debate

  * **Roe v. Wade** refers to the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. 
  * **Right to Choose** refers to a pro-choice stance, upholding Roe v. Wade. 
  * **Right to Life** refers to a pro-life stance, seeking to overturn or limit Roe v. Wade 
  * Pro-life advocates refer to Roe v. Wade as an example of **Judicial Activism** or legislating from the bench, i.e., that judges are making the law rather than interpreting it. In these terms, pro-life advocates believe in **Strict Constructionism**, or a literal interpretation of the Constitution with no implied rights. 
  * A **Litmus test** requires Vice Presidential & Supreme Court nominees to agree with ones abortion view. 
  * **The Human Life Amendment** would be a Constitutional Amendment overturning Roe v. Wade. There is currently no such Amendment pending, but proponents regularly introduce **Human Life Bills** in Congress. 
  * **States Rights**: Most pro-life legislation aims at overturning Roe v. Wade, which means returning the decision about abortion to the states. In contrast, a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution would ban abortion in all states. Overturning Roe v. Wade would NOT ban abortion -- it would then become a state decision, with some states allowing abortion and some restricting or banning it. 
  * **Contraception** is the surprise issue of the 2012 election campaign. It became relevant because ObamaCare requires that employers provide health insurance for employees, including contraceptives. At issue is when the employer is a church or other organization morally opposed to contraception. Conservatives call this a freedom of religion issue; liberals call it a war on women. 

### Roe v. Wade

The essence of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision is that Constitutional rights
apply only after birth; hence abortion does not breach a persons right to
life. States cannot regulate 1st trimester abortions; states can regulate but
not ban 2nd trimester abortions; and states can ban 3rd trimester abortions
(as many have).

### Planned Parenthood v. Casey

The Casey decision refers to the 1992 Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The Supreme Court upheld the 1973 Roe
v. Wade decision which established the right to an abortion, but allowed
restrictions on abortion. The Court cited the right to privacy, as well as
stare decisis, which means that a longstanding legal precedent should not be
overturned without a good reason.

### Fetal Viability

The debate on abortion generally focuses on when human life begins. The courts
often focus on **viability**, the point at which the fetus could survive
outside the womb.  
\- Viability naturally begins at about 6 months of pregnancy, but with modern
medical advances the age of viability is pushed back substantially.  
\- Strong pro-life advocates believe that the fetus should be protected from
the moment of conception.

### Abortion Legislation

The details of abortion legislation focus on what the states can regulate and
what they can ban in later trimesters:

  * **Partial-Birth Abortion** refers to a late-term abortion method which induces a breech delivery and collapses the fetal skull before completing delivery. This procedure is banned in 24 states, but pro-choice advocates, including President Clinton, have sought to overturn state laws with a federal ruling.   
\- In April 2000, the Supreme Court rejected a Nebraska law banning partial
birth abortions.  
\- In June 2000, the Court said that the Nebraska ban was unconstitutional
because it had no exceptions and barred second trimester abortions.

  * Each state decides if **Parental Consent** is required for teenagers seeking abortions. The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that spousal consent cannot be required by the states. 
  * Each state also determines rules about **informed consent**, about 24-hour waiting periods, and about when viability occurs after the 1st trimester. 
  * In Nov. 2005, the Supreme Court heard the case Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood, on the issue of parental consent (its first abortion case since 2000). They ruled in 2006 that states may require parental involvement, but not when it risks the health of the minor. No precedents were overturned nor set. 
  * In April 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the ban, but allowed for future cases about how it is applied. 

### Stem Cell Research

  * **Stem Cells** are undifferentiated cells, which are useful in research for cloning and for treating many diseases. Stem cells are best taken from human fetuses; hence the pro-life opposition. Many pro-life advocates support fetal stem cell research because of the medical potential. In 2001, Pres. Bush announced that the federal policy would be to allow fetal stem cell research on existing stem cell lines but not on new ones. 
  * **Embryonic Stem Cells** are stem cells derived from embryos, newborn's umbilical cords, etc. The 2008 election debate focuses entirely on embryonic stem cell research, because adult stem cell research (with source cells from non-embryonic sources) is no longer controversial. 
  * Pro-life advocates generally oppose embryonic stem cell research because of its use of pre-born human source material. There are notable exceptions, however, such as Nancy Reagan and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R, UT) where otherwise pro-life people support embryonic stem cell research for its healthcare benefits. 
  * As with the rest of the abortion debate, defining the playing field has become important in stem cell research. Defining stem cells as a healthcare issue is a pro-research stance. Defining stem cells as an issue about sanctity of life (e.g., as related to human cloning) is an anti-research stance. 
  * Most relevantly to the 2008 elections, the terminology focuses on the term "embryonic". Anti-research advocates will usually say they are "pro-stem cell research," omitting the key term "embryonic" to avoid alienating victims of diseases that might be cured by embryonic research. pro-research advocates will often say they are "for ALL stem cell research," omitting the controversial term "embryonic" to avoid alienating pro-life voters. 
  * Voters can discern candidates' views on the issue by listening to how the candidate describes adult stem cell research. If the politician considers adult stem cell research just another form of stem cell research, morally equivalent to embryonic stem cell research, then they are pro-embryonic research. If the politician sings the praises of adult stem cell research, for example, specifyinh medical accomplishments that arose from ADULT stem cells, then they are anti-embryonic research. 

### Related Legislation

* **Clinic Access** laws refer to what pro-life protesters may and may not do at the entrances to abortion clinics, and how far away they must stay. Clinic access became an issue after several abortion clinics were bombed and several abortion doctors were shot in recent years. 
* **RU-486** is a drug that induces abortion in early pregnancy. In September 2000, after 12 years of study, the FDA approved the use of RU-486 until the 7th week of pregnancy. 
* **Cloning** is a rapidly advancing technology in which a fetus develops from only one parent. It has been successful in animals, and is entering trial stages with humans. Pro-life advocates generally oppose cloning on the same basis that they oppose abortion. 

### Buzzwords in the abortion debate

  * Describing abortion as a health issue or as a women's rights issue is a pro-choice stance. 
  * Describing abortion as a moral issue or as an issue of balancing the mother's rights with the fetus' rights, is a pro-life stance. 
  * Both sides of the abortion debate attempt to define the playing-field in their favor by terminology. The pro-life name for pro-choice proponents is "pro-abortion", and the pro-choice name for pro=life proponents is "anti-choice". Using either of those charged terms defines the speaker as strongly one-sided (hence this website uses the more neutral terms "pro-life" and "pro-choice"). 
  * Any reference to "the rights of the unborn is a strong pro-life stance, as is defining life from the moment of conception. 
  * Any reference to the rights of the mother is a strong pro-choice stance, as is defining a right to privacy" (between a woman and her doctor). 
  * As mentioned above, the most obscure buzzword is that supporting judicial activism implies a pro-choice stance, while supporting strict constructionism implies a pro-life stance. In nominations for Supreme Court justices, asking this question is the archetypical Litmus Test -- liberal Senators spent many hours questioning Clarence Thomas on whether he held a Strict Constructionist view of the Constitution (he did not admit so). 
  * For serious policy wonks, the most important abortion buzzword is Stare Decisis -- that is the basis upon which Clarence Thomas declined to rule against Roe v. Wade. Thomas meant that although he would have ruled against Roe v. Wade in 1973, he would not do so now because the 1973 Supreme Court ruling had been in force for a quarter century and hence has precedential weight.
