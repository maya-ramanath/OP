Timothy Michael "Tim" Kaine (born February 26, 1958) is an American politician serving as the junior United States Senator from Virginia. A member of the Democratic Party, Kaine was elected to the Senate in 2012.
Born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Kaine is a graduate of Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kaine began his career as a clerk for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit before entering private practice and becoming a lecturer at the University of Richmond School of Law. Kaine was first elected to public office in 1995, when he won a seat on the Richmond, Virginia City Council. He was then elected Mayor of Richmond in 1998, serving in that position until being elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 2002.
As all Virginia governors are limited to one consecutive term, Kaine declared his candidacy for Governor of Virginia in 2005, in a bid to replace Mark Warner. Kaine won in an uncontested Democratic primary, and faced Republican Attorney General Jerry Kilgore in the general election; Kaine won with 51% of the vote, to Kilgore's 46%. Kaine served as governor from 2006 to 2010. Upon becoming governor, Kaine gave the Democratic response to the 2006 State of the Union Address. He was considered a top contender for running mate in Senator Barack Obama's successful 2008 presidential campaign, but instead became the 51st Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, serving from 2009 to 2011.
In 2012, after incumbent Senator Jim Webb announced that he would retire, Kaine declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. Kaine prevailed in the Democratic primary and faced former Senator and Virginia Governor George Allen in the general election. On November 6, 2012, Kaine won with 53% of the vote, to Allen's 47%. Kaine was sworn into office on January 3, 2013.


== Early life and education ==
Kaine was born at Saint Joseph's Hospital in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He is the son of Mary Kathleen (née Burns) and Albert Alexander Kaine, Jr., who worked as a welder and owned a small iron-working shop. He was raised Catholic. His father is of Scottish and Irish descent, and his mother is of Irish ancestry. Kaine grew up in the Kansas City area and graduated from Rockhurst High School in Kansas City, Missouri.
Kaine graduated from the University of Missouri with a B.A. in economics in 1979. Kaine was a Coro Foundation fellow in Kansas City in 1978. He attended Harvard Law School, taking a year-long break during law school to work with the Jesuit order as a Catholic missionary in Honduras. Kaine is fluent in Spanish as a result of his year in Honduras. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1983 with a Juris Doctor, and was admitted to the Virginia Bar. He clerked for Judge R. Lanier Anderson III of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In 1984, Kaine married former Richmond Juvenile Court Judge Anne Holton. Holton is the daughter of former Virginia governor A. Linwood Holton, Jr. Kaine and Holton have three children, Nat, Woody, and Annella.
Kaine practiced law in Richmond for 17 years, specializing in representing people who had been denied housing opportunities because of their race or disability. He was recognized by local, state, and national organizations for his advocacy of fair housing. He also taught legal ethics for six years at the University of Richmond Law School. More than ten years into his legal career in 1994, he was elected to the city council of the independent city of Richmond from the portion of the city in which he resided under Richmond's system of nine wards.


== Mayor of Richmond (1998–2001) ==
He was elected mayor of Richmond by the city council in 1998. (Until 2004, the mayor of Richmond was chosen by the city council from among its membership; under the present system, the mayor is chosen by popular vote.) He spent seven years on the city council, including two terms as mayor.
Under Kaine's leadership, Richmond saw the construction of its first new schools in a generation, tax cuts, and a reduction in the city’s crime rate. Richmond’s success in reducing violent crime, including a 55 percent drop in the city's homicide rate during his tenure, earned national recognition from Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Richmond's economic success during Kaine’s tenure earned the city its first-ever listing in Forbes magazine’s annual ranking of the top 10 cities in America for doing business.
As mayor, Kaine gained national attention following the implementation of a gun law known as Project Exile, an initiative that moved trials for armed defendants to federal court, which has stiffer sentencing guidelines.
During his tenure as mayor, Kaine drew criticism for designating public funds for an anti-gun-violence rally. After a constituent raised concerns about the funding at a Richmond City Council meeting, Kaine raised the money privately and reimbursed the city.


== Lieutenant governor (2002–2005) ==
In the Virginia general elections of November 2001, Kaine ran for lieutenant governor and won with 925,974 votes (50.35%). His opponents were Republican state Delegate Jay Katzen, with 883,886 votes (48.06%) and Libertarian Gary Reams, with 28,783 votes (1.57%). Kaine was inaugurated on January 12, 2002. As lieutenant governor, he also served as president of the Virginia Senate.


== 2005 gubernatorial election ==

In 2005, Kaine ran for and won the office of governor of Virginia in the November general election, defeating Republican former Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore with 52% of the vote to Kilgore's 46%.
An underdog for most of the race, Kaine led in some polls for the first time in October 2005, and held his lead into the final week before the election. While the previous Democratic governor, Mark Warner, was credited with doing especially well for a Democrat in rural areas of the commonwealth, Kaine's win featured surprising triumphs in traditionally Republican areas such as Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and the Northern Virginia exurbs of Prince William County and Loudoun County, as well as impressive showings in Democratic strongholds such as Richmond and Norfolk.
Kaine closely associated himself with popular outgoing Democratic Governor Mark Warner during his campaign; he won his race with a slightly smaller portion of the vote than Warner did, but achieved a slightly wider margin on account of the third-party candidate's comparatively greater success in 2005. A number of factors, from the poll numbers of President George W. Bush to public reaction to the death penalty ads run by Kilgore, have also been cited as contributing to his decisive win. Kaine was inaugurated in Williamsburg on January 14, 2006. Upon his inauguration, he became the first Catholic governor in Virginia history.


== Governor of Virginia (2006–2010) ==


=== Democratic response to State of the Union address ===
On January 31, 2006, Kaine gave the Democratic response to President Bush's 2006 State of the Union address. In his response, he argued that the Republicans failed to support bipartisanship in Washington and he condemned Bush's spending increases and tax cuts as "reckless".


=== Budget special session ===
In March 2006, after the Virginia General Assembly failed to come up with a budget, Kaine called for a special session that continued until June. The debate was over transportation issues and how to fund current and new projects. Most of the debate originated in a struggle within the Republican-controlled Senate and House of Delegates. In 2007, however, a transportation bill was passed and signed into law by Kaine.


=== Conservation ===
In May 2006, Governor Kaine announced his plan to protect 400,000 acres (1,600 km2) of Virginia land from development before the end of his service as Governor of Virginia. Kaine's conservation efforts focus on encouraging landowners to donate protective easements that restrict development. As of 2007, according to government statistics, Maryland spends as much as $21 per capita on land conservation, while Virginia spends $1.45. On the other hand, Virginia also has a higher proportion of its total land area under permanent protection than many other states, with about 13.69% of it currently protected.


=== Smoking ===
In October 2006, Kaine signed an executive order banning smoking in all government buildings and state-owned cars as of January 1, 2007. He signed legislation banning smoking in restaurants and bars, with some exceptions, in March 2009, making Virginia the first Southern state to do so.


=== Civil War records ===
Kaine announced that Virginia would be the first state to digitize records from the Civil War Era Freedmen's Bureau. This would facilitate research into post-Civil War African-American history.


=== HPV vaccinations ===

In 2007, large bipartisan majorities in the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a law that mandated HPV vaccine immunization for all sixth-grade girls in Virginia. It included a provision allowing parents to opt out of the requirement without citing a reason. After expressing "some qualms", Kaine signed the bill into law saying that "The particular language that ended up in the bill is fine. It's very broad, and people get information about the health benefits and any health concerns about the vaccination, and they get to make their own decisions. I think that is the right balance." Virginia was the second state to enact such legislation, following Texas.


=== Virginia Tech shooting ===
When news of the Virginia Tech shootings broke, Kaine canceled a trade mission to Japan and India to attend to the situation. Kaine spoke at the convocation held in Blacksburg the day after the shooting in which he invoked the Biblical story of Job. Kaine said he would appoint a panel of independent law-enforcement officials to determine what the university knew about the student responsible for the massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 32 people.
The commission, led by former Virginia State Police Superintendent Gerald Massengill and former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, began work on April 28, 2007, and issued its findings and recommendations on August 30, 2007. On April 30, 2007, Governor Kaine signed an executive order instructing state agencies to step up efforts to block gun sales to people involuntarily committed to inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment centers. Kaine's quick return to the state and his handling of the issue received widespread praise.


=== Metro ===
In July 2007, during the debate on the Silver Line of the Washington Metro through Tysons Corner, Kaine supported an elevated track solution in preference to a tunnel, citing costs and potential delays that would put federal funding at risk.


=== Education ===
During the 2008 General Assembly session, Governor Kaine backed a $22 million proposal to make pre-kindergarten education more accessible to at-risk four-year-olds.


=== Omeish resignation ===
Kaine appointed Esam Omeish to the Virginia Commission on Immigration, which was examining whether Virginia should do more to restrict illegal immigration. In September 2007, Omeish resigned as a commission member—as requested by Kaine—three hours after remarks made by Omeish on a call-in show on WRVA radio in Richmond were brought to Kaine's attention, specifically his criticisms of the Israel lobby and call for Bush's impeachment on account of the Iraq War. "I have been made aware of certain statements he has made which concern me," Kaine said in accepting Omeish's resignation. Kaine added that background checks would be more thorough in the future.


=== Coal power plant ===
Kaine's support of a coal-fired power plant in Wise County that would emit an estimated 5.4 million tons of carbon dioxide per year was opposed by environmentalists.


=== Cabinet ===
Chief of Staff — William Leighty (2006–2007), Wayne Turnage (2007–2010)
Secretary of Administration – Viola Baskerville (2006–2010)

== 2008 vice presidential speculation ==

Kaine was considered as a possible running mate for Barack Obama in 2008, but was not chosen. Kaine first supported Senator Obama's presidential bid in February 2007. It was maintained that Kaine's endorsement was the first from a statewide elected official outside of Illinois. Since Kaine was a relatively popular governor of a southern state, there was media speculation that he was a potential nominee for Vice President. Obama had supported Kaine in his campaign for governor and had said about him: "Tim Kaine has a message of fiscal responsibility and generosity of spirit. That kind of message can sell anywhere." On July 28, 2008, Politico reported that Kaine was "very, very high" on Obama's shortlist for vice president, a list which also included then Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, Governor Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, and Senator Joe Biden of Delaware. Obama ultimately selected Biden to become the vice-presidential nominee.


== Democratic Party chair (2009–2011) ==
In January 2009, Kaine became the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. He took the position at the request of President Obama, and during his tenure he oversaw a significant expansion of the party's grassroots focus through Organizing for America.
In February 2011, it was reported that President Obama had joined Wisconsin's budget battle and would oppose the Republican anti-union bill. The Washington Post reported that Organizing for America, the political operation for the White House, got involved after Kaine spoke to union leaders in Madison. They made phone calls, sent emails, and distributed messages via Facebook and Twitter to work on building crowds for the rallies.


== United States Senate ==


=== 2012 election ===

Kaine announced on April 5, 2011 that he would run for United States Senate in 2012, following Senator Jim Webb's decision not to seek re-election. Kaine filmed announcement videos in English and Spanish. Kaine was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. Kaine defeated former Senator and Governor George Allen in the general election. Mike Henry was chosen as Kaine's campaign manager.


=== Tenure ===
Kaine was sworn in for a six-year term on January 3, 2013, reuniting him with Mark Warner, the senior senator. When Warner was governor of Virginia, Kaine was his lieutenant governor.
On 11 June 2013, Kaine delivered a speech on the Senate floor in support of the bi-partisan "Gang of Eight" immigration bill. The speech was entirely in Spanish, marking the first time a Senator had ever made a speech on the Senate floor in a language other than English.
In July 2013, Kaine was named chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Armed Services
Subcommittee on Personnel
Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support
Subcommittee on Seapower

Committee on the Budget
Committee on Foreign Relations


== 2016 vice presidential speculation ==

Kaine endorsed Hillary Clinton's presidential bid in 2014, and campaigned actively for Clinton in seven states during the primaries. He has been the subject of considerable speculation as a possible running mate for Clinton, with several news reports indicating that he is at or near the top of Clinton's list of people under consideration, alongside figures such as Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro.


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Kaine, a Roman Catholic, is for religious reasons privately against abortion, but opposes overturning Roe v. Wade. On his 2012 Senate campaign website he says, "I strongly support the right of women to make their own health and reproductive decisions and, for that reason, will oppose efforts to weaken or subvert the basic holding of Roe v. Wade."
Kaine asserts that he has encouraged policymakers to focus on bringing down the number of abortions by reducing teen pregnancy through abstinence-focused education, ensuring women's access to health care and contraception, and promoting adoption. He supports some legal restrictions on abortion, such as requiring parental consent and banning late term abortions in cases where the woman's life is not at risk.


=== Afghanistan and ISIL ===
On the issue of the war in Afghanistan, Tim Kaine's website states "The main mission in Afghanistan—destroying Al Qaeda—is nearly complete and we should bring our troops home as quickly as we can, consistent with the need to make sure that Afghanistan poses no danger in the broader region."
In November 2014, at the Halifax International Security Forum, Kaine together with Senator John McCain emphasized the necessity of Congressional authorization for military operations against ISIS. "You just can't have a war without Congress", Kaine declared in Halifax.
On December 11, 2014 after a five-month campaign by Kaine, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved by 10–8 (straight party lines) a measure authorizing military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), but barring the use of ground troops.


=== Capital punishment ===
Despite his personal opposition to capital punishment, often cited during the 2005 campaign by both sides, Kaine oversaw eleven executions as governor, including the execution of John Allen Muhammad, the Beltway Sniper, on November 10, 2009. He has vetoed eight death-penalty expansion bills although some of the vetoes were overturned, and opposed the electric chair as an option. On June 9, 2008, Kaine commuted the death sentence of Percy Levar Walton to life in prison without parole.


=== Healthcare ===
Kaine supported passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare. On this issue, Kaine said, “I was a supporter and remain a supporter of the Affordable Care Act. I felt like it was a statement that we were going to put some things in the rear view mirror."
On September 27, 2013, Kaine voted to restore funding for ObamaCare as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days, and which also omitted House-passed language prioritizing debt payments if Congress fails to increase the nation’s borrowing limits.


=== LGBT rights ===
When talking about gay marriage in 2005, Kaine said that "No couples in Virginia can adopt other than a married couple — that's the right policy. Gay individuals should be able to adopt." In 2011, however, Kaine would change his position and become more open to the idea of adoption. Kaine said he believed that the judges would be able to make effective case-by-case analyses when dealing with unmarried couples applying to be possible parents. He said that he was open to consideration being made available to all couples, gay or straight.
On May 8, 2012 Kaine said that "There should be a license that would entitle a committed couple to the same rights as a married couple." In March 2013, Kaine announced his support of same-sex marriage.


=== Local issues ===
Kaine supports some "smart growth"–style policies to manage sprawl and transportation issues; he refers to these plans as "balanced growth".


=== Taxes ===
Kaine says that he supports allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for those with high incomes. Kaine also stated during a debate that he would be open to establishing a minimum tax that everyone must pay.
In 2012, Kaine supported raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes. He said: "For Social Security, we can raise the income payroll tax cap so that it covers a similar percentage of income as it did in the 1980s under President Reagan, which would greatly extend the solvency of the program."
Kaine supports introducing an internet sales tax that would require online retailers to collect the same sales taxes that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers currently collect.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Keep God in the public sphere **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: Judeo-Christian values _are_ American values. Belief in God is what America was founded upon, so tax-funding religious organizations, or praying in school, does not violate the separation of church and state. Displaying the Ten Commandments is appropriate because they are the moral basis for Western law. The Pledge of Allegiance should continue to include the phrase "Under God." 
  * **Support** means you believe: We need to teach values in our schools and account for our religious values in providing social services. The more our children are exposed to prayer, the Ten Commandments, and other traditional values, the better off they are. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Faith-based origanizations and prayer in schools are inappropriate because they fail to recognize American pluralism and religious diversity. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Separation of church and state precludes allowing school prayer, or providing funding for religious organizations. It also precludes other aspects of religion in government buildings, such as posting the Ten Commandments in public places. We should not violate the Constitutional principle in this case. 

This question is looking for you views on how religion should play a part in
public institutions.  However you answer the above question would be similar
to your response to these statements:

  * Post the Ten Commandments in public schools 
  * "Separation of church and state" does not mean "keep religion out of schools"
  * "Separation of church and state" does not preclude "faith-based organizations" providing social services 
  * Nativity scenes on City Hall lawns are acceptable 
  * Organized Prayer In Public Schools 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** that religious institutions should be involved in welfare or education. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** reasons that religious institutions are better equipped than government to help with charitable causes and education. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe government oversight is needed for **practical** reasons of effectiveness or full inclusiveness. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of church-state separation precludes the involvement of religious institutions in social services. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

### 2012 Election Welfare Issues

  * **_Faith-Based Welfare**_: President Bush initiated the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships to institute his Charitable Choice proposal. Churches are tax-exempt, and donations to churches and other charities are tax-deductible; Pres. Bush's policy was intended to encourage churches to perform more social services. Proponents focus on removing restrictions on religious organizations' activities, so that churches can bid on government block grants for performing welfare services. Opponents claim that lessens restrictions on separation of church and state. 

  * **_Separation of church and state**_: The US Constitution does not mandate "separation of church and state." That phrase comes from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson while President, in 1802. The Constitution's "Establishment Clause" says that the US will have no state church (known as an "established religion"), which has been interpreted to mean the federal government cannot fund one church over another. 

### Welfare-to-Work

  * The welfare reform bill, signed by President Clinton in 1996, ended the federal entitlement to welfare, imposed strict work requirements on recipients, and set a five-year lifetime limit for aid. 
  * In 1995, 88% of poor children received food stamps. By 1998 the figure had dropped to 70%. 
  * The welfare load currently stands at about 2 million recipients, which has dropped by about 1/3 since the welfare reform bill was enacted.  

### Faith-Based Organizations

  * As welfare decreases, churches and other faith-based organizations (FBOs) pick up the slack. 
  * Churches are tax-exempt, and donations to churches and other charities are tax-deductible, so federal activity focuses on tax reform to encourage donations, by increasing deductibility on federal and state income taxes. 
  * Other recent Congressional bills focus on removing restrictions on religious organizations' activities, so that churches can bid on government block grants for performing welfare services. 
  * The lessening of restrictions on separation of church and state for this purpose is known as Charitable Choice.  

### **_NCLB**_ \- No Child Left Behind

  * NCLB is the 2001 bipartisan law intended to improve K-12 schools, under the theory of **_standards-based education reform**_. 
  * States are required to establish **_standardized testing**_, so that all high school graduates meet the test criteria. 
  * States are also required to give options (school choice) to students who attend schools that fail to meet NCLB's **_Adequate Yearly Progress**_ (AYP). 
  * The controversy over NCLB currently focuses on funding: **_Opponents of NCLB**_ argue that states are provided inadequate federal funding for implementation of NCLB, and that therefore NCLB represents an "unfunded mandate" on states. 
  * **_Proponents of NCLB**_ argue that the law provides accountability for schools; fights against incompetent teachers; and provides alternatives to failing schools. 
  * Progress is measured in the federal [National Assessment of Educational Progress](http://nationsreportcard.gov/) (NAEP), commonly knows as the "Nation's Report Card."  

### Education Buzzwords

  * **_Intelligent Design: **_ refers to species development run by intelligent designer (implying God, without the explicitly religious terminology). In contrast, evolution teaches a random process for natural species development. Critics have called intelligent design a thinly disguised version of creationism, which takes a literal approach to the creation account in Genesis, that the earth was created in six days and is less than 10,000 years old. 

  * **_Social Promotion: **_ Candidates debate whether students should advance a grade merely to keep up with their peer group. 90% of K-12 students are promoted (10% per year are retained). 
  * **_Teacher Pay: **_ K-12 Teachers salaries average $34,200; college instructors average $63,000; compared to $50,700 for similarly educated non-teachers. Public school teachers earn 25% to 100% more than private school teachers. Generally, any reference to increasing teacher pay implies opposition to [vouchers](../Background_Education.htm#School_Choice) while negative references to teachers unions implies support of vouchers. 

  * **_Teacher Testing: **_ Current law is that states certify teachers and decide what their requirements are; there are currently no national standards nor testing. Liberals favor raising teacher pay and oppose teacher testing on the grounds of treating teachers more professionally. 

  * **_Student Testing: **_ Many conservatives advocate for national testing standard or other forms of standards-based education. Generally, any reference to standards, or especially to dealing with failing schools, implies support of [school vouchers.](../Background_Education.htm#School_Choice)

  * **_Smaller Class Size: **_ Many liberals advocate for smaller class sizes, and/or building more schools to achieve them. Generally, any reference to smaller classrooms, or especially to building public schools, implies opposition to [funding private schools.](../Background_School_Choice.htm)

  * **_School Prayer: **_ Current law is that schools allow religious groups to organize on school grounds as if they are any club. Schools are not allowed to conduct prayers at the beginning of school, but neither are they allowed to stop a student from praying. 

  * **_Bilingual Education: **_ Schools may conduct classes in Spanish or other languages using federal Title VII funds, which totaled $380 million last year (1% of total spending). 13% of K-12 students speak a language other than English at home. Generally, liberals favor bilingual education while conservatives favor official English. 

  * **_DOE: **_ The Department of Education spent $38 billion last year (2% of the federal budget). But federal spending only accounts for 9% of education spending; most of the annual $600 billion comes from state & local sources. Hard-core conservatives favor abolishing the Department of Education, which was a Republican Party platform plank in the 1980s. 

  * **_Phonics: **_ Phonics is a method of teaching children to read by sounding out phonemes (groups of letters that represent sounds). Generally, a favorable reference to phonics implies a conservative viewpoint on all the other education issues listed here. 

### School Choice

School Choice generally refers to a school district allowing parents to decide
which school within the district to send their kids to. The political issue is
whether to allow the choice to include private schools, parochial schools, and
home schooling at taxpayer expense. Taxpayer funding of parochial schools
potentially violates the Constitutional separation of church and state.
Taxpayer funding of private schools is controversial because it subsidizes
parents who are currently paying for private schools themselves, and are
usually more wealthy than the average public school family.

### Charter Schools

Charter schools are publicly-funded and publicly-controlled schools which are
privately run. They are usually required to adhere to fewer district rules
than regular public schools.

### Vouchers

Vouchers are a means of implementing school choice -- parents are given a
voucher by the school district, which entitles them to, say, $4,000 applicable
to either public school or private school tuition. The value of the voucher is
generally lower than the cost of one year of public education (which averages
$5,200), so private schools (where tuition averages $8,500) may require cash
payment in addition to the voucher.

### Education Buzzwords

Generally, any reference to standards, or especially to dealing with failing
schools, implies support of school vouchers. Generally, any reference to
smaller classrooms, or especially to building public schools, implies
opposition to funding private schools. Further decoding of education buzzwords
are detailed under [Education](../Background_Education.htm).

### K-12 Education Statistics

  * **_Total spending is $260 billion**_, (7% federal; the rest split state & local) rising by 5% per year. 
  * **_Student population is 50 million**_, rising slowly (1 million per year) since 1984. 
  * **_Public school spending is $5,200 per student**_, staying about even with inflation. 
  * **_Parochial school costs $4,200 per student**_, not discounting church-provided buildings & other subsidies. 
  * **_Private school costs $8,500 per student**_, not discounting scholarships or other financial aid. 
  * **_90% attend public schools**_; about 6 million attend private & parochial schools. 
  * **_78% of schools have Internet access**_; 97% plan to by the year 2000. 
  * **_27% of classrooms have Internet access**_; lower in poor and minority schools. 

### College Education & Cost Statistics

  * 61% of high school graduates continue on to some post-secondary education. 
  * 43% enroll at 4-year colleges; 33% graduate college. 
  * Race strongly determines the percentage enrolling at college   
(49% for Asians; 38% for Blacks; 28% for Hispanics).

  * Socioeconomic status even more strongly determines percentage enrolling at college
