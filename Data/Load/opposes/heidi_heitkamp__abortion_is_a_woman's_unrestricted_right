Mary Kathryn "Heidi" Heitkamp (born October 30, 1955) is the junior United States Senator from North Dakota, in office since 2013, and a member of the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party. She was the 28th North Dakota Attorney General, serving from 1993 to 2001, and State Tax Commissioner from 1989 to 1993.
Heitkamp was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in the 2000 gubernatorial election, losing to John Hoeven. She considered a bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2010 U.S. Senate election to replace retiring Senator Byron Dorgan, but on March 3, 2010, declined the rematch against Hoeven, who was ultimately elected.
In November 2011, Heitkamp declared her candidacy to replace Kent Conrad as U.S. Senator from North Dakota in the 2012 election. She narrowly defeated Republican Congressman Rick Berg on November 6, 2012, in that year's closest Senate race, with Berg conceding the next day. She is North Dakota's second female senator, after Jocelyn Burdick, and the first to be elected.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
Heitkamp was born in Breckenridge, Minnesota, the fourth of seven children of Doreen LaVonne (née Berg) and Raymond Bernard Heitkamp. Her father was of German descent, while her mother is of half Norwegian and half German ancestry. Heitkamp was raised in Mantador, North Dakota. She earned a B.A. from the University of North Dakota in 1977 and a J.D. from Lewis and Clark Law School in 1980.
In 1980-81, she was an attorney for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. She next worked for the Office of the North Dakota State Tax Commissioner as an attorney. In 1986, incumbent State Tax Commissioner Kent Conrad decided to retire in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Heitkamp ran for the position and won the statewide election with 66% of the vote against Republican Marshall Moore. She served in that position until 1992.


== Attorney General ==
In 1992, the incumbent North Dakota Attorney General, Democrat Nick Spaeth, decided to retire in order to run for governor of North Dakota. Heitkamp ran for the position and won with 62% of the vote. In 1996, she won reelection with 64% of the vote.
Heitkamp's best-known achievement as Attorney General of North Dakota was to lead the state's legal efforts against tobacco companies, which resulted in the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. This provides for the tobacco companies to pay the state funds to be applied to health care costs.


== 2000 gubernatorial election ==

In 2000, incumbent Republican Governor Ed Schafer decided not to seek a third term. Heitkamp ran and was unopposed in the primary. On the Republican side, John Hoeven, CEO of Bank of North Dakota, also ran unopposed. During her campaign for governor it was announced that Heitkamp had been diagnosed with breast cancer, which is now in remission. Hoeven defeated her 55% to 45%. Heitkamp won 12 of the state's 53 counties.


== Business career (2001–2011) ==
Heitkamp served as the director of Dakota Gasification Company's Great Plains Synfuels Plant from 2001 to 2012.  Her brother, Joel, is a radio talk-show host and former North Dakota state senator. Heitkamp has occasionally filled in for her brother as host of his program, News and Views, which is broadcast on Clear Channel stations in North Dakota.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== 2012 election ===

In January 2011, incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Kent Conrad announced his intent to retire instead of seeking a fourth full term in 2012. On November 8, 2011, she announced that she would seek the open seat. She vowed to be "an independent voice."
Heitkamp was attacked in commercials for accepting campaign contributions from a trial lawyer, Jack McConnell, Jr., assigned by her to help North Dakota implement its settlement with tobacco companies when she served as state attorney general. She released an ad to respond to these allegations. 
Heitkamp won the November 6, 2012, Senate election by 2,994 votes, less than 1% of the ballots cast. Berg conceded the race the next day. If he had not, the race could have been subject to a "demand recount" under North Dakota law, which permits candidates to demand a recount if they lose an election by more than 0.5% but less than 2% of the vote cast for the candidate receiving the most votes for the office sought. Upon winning the election, Heitkamp became North Dakota's second female U.S. Senator. She serves alongside her former gubernatorial opponent John Hoeven.

== Political positions ==


=== Health care ===
Heitkamp has said that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains "good and bad" and "it needs to be fixed." She criticized her Senate opponent Rick Berg for wanting to repeal the law, citing concerns about insurance companies denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions. Berg and the NRSC criticized Heitkamp for offering unqualified support for the health care law until she ran for the Senate in 2011, citing footage of her at a 2010 rally where she called the bill "a legacy vote" without any criticism of it.
During the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Heitkamp criticized Republican attempts to use the Continuing Appropriations Resolution as "a vehicle to legislate other issues," such as the defunding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a delay of its individual mandate. Heitkamp was one of 14 members of the bipartisan Senate group that negotiated the compromise that was the basis of the eventual deal to end the shutdown. During the government shutdown in 2013 Heitkamp donated about $8,000 of her salary to North Dakota charities that support veterans, provide healthcare supplies to those that cannot afford them, and raise Breast Cancer awareness.


=== Spending ===
Heitkamp said she would support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution "with exceptions" if elected. Heitkamp said such exceptions would include wartime spending, Social Security, Medicare, and a ban on tax cuts for those making more than $1 million per year.


=== Taxes ===
Heitkamp announced in a campaign press release in 2012 that she supports the Buffett Rule. Heitkamp supports implementing the Buffett Rule via the Paying a Fair Share Act, which would require those making a gross income of $1,000,000 or more to pay at least a 30% federal tax rate.


=== Filibuster reform ===
Heitkamp said she supports reforming the filibuster in the United States Senate, but did not specifically endorse the Merkley/Udall/Harkin proposal for doing so.


=== Energy ===
Heitkamp said she supports the Keystone XL pipeline because it will create jobs, decrease America's dependence on foreign oil from the Middle East, and help drive down the national debt. She also said many who oppose hydraulic fracturing have been exposed to "junk science" and do not know what it really is. She was Climate Hawks Vote's lowest-rated Democratic senator on climate leadership in the 113th Congress and remains among the lowest in 2015.


=== Same-sex marriage ===
On April 5, 2013, Heitkamp announced her support of same-sex marriage, along with fellow Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly (D-Indiana), who entered the Senate the same time Heitkamp did. Both are Roman Catholics.


=== Gun control ===
On April 11, 2013, Heitkamp explained in an interview that she intended to vote against the Manchin-Toomey amendment introduced in the Senate after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which would have amended the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to expand background checks to gun shows and internet purchases. Heitkamp said, "I'm going to represent my state. ... in the end it's not what any other senator believes. It's about what the people of North Dakota believe." Polling suggests that the majority of North Dakotans approve of prohibiting individuals on the No-Fly list from buying firearms and ammunition, but in June 2016, after the Orlando nightclub mass shooting, Heitkamp voted against such a prohibition. She was the only Democratic senator to do so. She instead appeared in support of a "compromise gun bill" proposed by Susan Collins.


== Personal life ==
Heitkamp is married to Darwin Lange, a family practitioner. They reside in Mandan and are the parents of two adult children, Ali and Nathan.

** Abortion is a woman's unrestricted right **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe: Abortion is a private decision between a woman and her doctor. You believe in the `Right to Choose' and are strongly pro-choice. The right to abortion empowers women and is an important part of women's health rights and women's reproductive freedom. That right includes the right to a government subsidy for poor women who want an abortion. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Restricting `Partial-Birth Abortions' or other specific procedures is reasonable, but clinic access should be unfettered, since other women may choose differently than you. You are pro-choice, but believe that some restrictions are acceptable. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: The fetus is a human being who has rights independent of its mother's rights. You are "pro-life." While abortion under certain circumstances might be tolerated, the basic rights belong to the fetus, not the mother. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Abortion is immoral because it kills a human being, and should never be tolerated. `Roe v. Wade' should be overturned and we should protest abortion clinics as other forms of injustice are protested. 

This question is looking for your views on abortion rights in general.
However you answer the above question would be similar to your response to
these statements:

  * Uphold Roe v. Wade 
  * No Litmus Test for nominees 
  * Enforce Clinic Access laws 
  * Oppose Strict Constructionist judges 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of the right to choose. 
  * **Support** means you believe that abortions will occur anyway so we should make them safe for **practical** reasons. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe more **practical** limitations are appropriate to make abortions rarer. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that abortion violates the **principle** of taking a fetus' life. 

**BACKGROUND**

### Basic terminology of the abortion debate

  * **Roe v. Wade** refers to the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. 
  * **Right to Choose** refers to a pro-choice stance, upholding Roe v. Wade. 
  * **Right to Life** refers to a pro-life stance, seeking to overturn or limit Roe v. Wade 
  * Pro-life advocates refer to Roe v. Wade as an example of **Judicial Activism** or legislating from the bench, i.e., that judges are making the law rather than interpreting it. In these terms, pro-life advocates believe in **Strict Constructionism**, or a literal interpretation of the Constitution with no implied rights. 
  * A **Litmus test** requires Vice Presidential & Supreme Court nominees to agree with ones abortion view. 
  * **The Human Life Amendment** would be a Constitutional Amendment overturning Roe v. Wade. There is currently no such Amendment pending, but proponents regularly introduce **Human Life Bills** in Congress. 
  * **States Rights**: Most pro-life legislation aims at overturning Roe v. Wade, which means returning the decision about abortion to the states. In contrast, a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution would ban abortion in all states. Overturning Roe v. Wade would NOT ban abortion -- it would then become a state decision, with some states allowing abortion and some restricting or banning it. 
  * **Contraception** is the surprise issue of the 2012 election campaign. It became relevant because ObamaCare requires that employers provide health insurance for employees, including contraceptives. At issue is when the employer is a church or other organization morally opposed to contraception. Conservatives call this a freedom of religion issue; liberals call it a war on women. 

### Roe v. Wade

The essence of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision is that Constitutional rights
apply only after birth; hence abortion does not breach a persons right to
life. States cannot regulate 1st trimester abortions; states can regulate but
not ban 2nd trimester abortions; and states can ban 3rd trimester abortions
(as many have).

### Planned Parenthood v. Casey

The Casey decision refers to the 1992 Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The Supreme Court upheld the 1973 Roe
v. Wade decision which established the right to an abortion, but allowed
restrictions on abortion. The Court cited the right to privacy, as well as
stare decisis, which means that a longstanding legal precedent should not be
overturned without a good reason.

### Fetal Viability

The debate on abortion generally focuses on when human life begins. The courts
often focus on **viability**, the point at which the fetus could survive
outside the womb.  
\- Viability naturally begins at about 6 months of pregnancy, but with modern
medical advances the age of viability is pushed back substantially.  
\- Strong pro-life advocates believe that the fetus should be protected from
the moment of conception.

### Abortion Legislation

The details of abortion legislation focus on what the states can regulate and
what they can ban in later trimesters:

  * **Partial-Birth Abortion** refers to a late-term abortion method which induces a breech delivery and collapses the fetal skull before completing delivery. This procedure is banned in 24 states, but pro-choice advocates, including President Clinton, have sought to overturn state laws with a federal ruling.   
\- In April 2000, the Supreme Court rejected a Nebraska law banning partial
birth abortions.  
\- In June 2000, the Court said that the Nebraska ban was unconstitutional
because it had no exceptions and barred second trimester abortions.

  * Each state decides if **Parental Consent** is required for teenagers seeking abortions. The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that spousal consent cannot be required by the states. 
  * Each state also determines rules about **informed consent**, about 24-hour waiting periods, and about when viability occurs after the 1st trimester. 
  * In Nov. 2005, the Supreme Court heard the case Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood, on the issue of parental consent (its first abortion case since 2000). They ruled in 2006 that states may require parental involvement, but not when it risks the health of the minor. No precedents were overturned nor set. 
  * In April 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the ban, but allowed for future cases about how it is applied. 

### Stem Cell Research

  * **Stem Cells** are undifferentiated cells, which are useful in research for cloning and for treating many diseases. Stem cells are best taken from human fetuses; hence the pro-life opposition. Many pro-life advocates support fetal stem cell research because of the medical potential. In 2001, Pres. Bush announced that the federal policy would be to allow fetal stem cell research on existing stem cell lines but not on new ones. 
  * **Embryonic Stem Cells** are stem cells derived from embryos, newborn's umbilical cords, etc. The 2008 election debate focuses entirely on embryonic stem cell research, because adult stem cell research (with source cells from non-embryonic sources) is no longer controversial. 
  * Pro-life advocates generally oppose embryonic stem cell research because of its use of pre-born human source material. There are notable exceptions, however, such as Nancy Reagan and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R, UT) where otherwise pro-life people support embryonic stem cell research for its healthcare benefits. 
  * As with the rest of the abortion debate, defining the playing field has become important in stem cell research. Defining stem cells as a healthcare issue is a pro-research stance. Defining stem cells as an issue about sanctity of life (e.g., as related to human cloning) is an anti-research stance. 
  * Most relevantly to the 2008 elections, the terminology focuses on the term "embryonic". Anti-research advocates will usually say they are "pro-stem cell research," omitting the key term "embryonic" to avoid alienating victims of diseases that might be cured by embryonic research. pro-research advocates will often say they are "for ALL stem cell research," omitting the controversial term "embryonic" to avoid alienating pro-life voters. 
  * Voters can discern candidates' views on the issue by listening to how the candidate describes adult stem cell research. If the politician considers adult stem cell research just another form of stem cell research, morally equivalent to embryonic stem cell research, then they are pro-embryonic research. If the politician sings the praises of adult stem cell research, for example, specifyinh medical accomplishments that arose from ADULT stem cells, then they are anti-embryonic research. 

### Related Legislation

* **Clinic Access** laws refer to what pro-life protesters may and may not do at the entrances to abortion clinics, and how far away they must stay. Clinic access became an issue after several abortion clinics were bombed and several abortion doctors were shot in recent years. 
* **RU-486** is a drug that induces abortion in early pregnancy. In September 2000, after 12 years of study, the FDA approved the use of RU-486 until the 7th week of pregnancy. 
* **Cloning** is a rapidly advancing technology in which a fetus develops from only one parent. It has been successful in animals, and is entering trial stages with humans. Pro-life advocates generally oppose cloning on the same basis that they oppose abortion. 

### Buzzwords in the abortion debate

  * Describing abortion as a health issue or as a women's rights issue is a pro-choice stance. 
  * Describing abortion as a moral issue or as an issue of balancing the mother's rights with the fetus' rights, is a pro-life stance. 
  * Both sides of the abortion debate attempt to define the playing-field in their favor by terminology. The pro-life name for pro-choice proponents is "pro-abortion", and the pro-choice name for pro=life proponents is "anti-choice". Using either of those charged terms defines the speaker as strongly one-sided (hence this website uses the more neutral terms "pro-life" and "pro-choice"). 
  * Any reference to "the rights of the unborn is a strong pro-life stance, as is defining life from the moment of conception. 
  * Any reference to the rights of the mother is a strong pro-choice stance, as is defining a right to privacy" (between a woman and her doctor). 
  * As mentioned above, the most obscure buzzword is that supporting judicial activism implies a pro-choice stance, while supporting strict constructionism implies a pro-life stance. In nominations for Supreme Court justices, asking this question is the archetypical Litmus Test -- liberal Senators spent many hours questioning Clarence Thomas on whether he held a Strict Constructionist view of the Constitution (he did not admit so). 
  * For serious policy wonks, the most important abortion buzzword is Stare Decisis -- that is the basis upon which Clarence Thomas declined to rule against Roe v. Wade. Thomas meant that although he would have ruled against Roe v. Wade in 1973, he would not do so now because the 1973 Supreme Court ruling had been in force for a quarter century and hence has precedential weight.
