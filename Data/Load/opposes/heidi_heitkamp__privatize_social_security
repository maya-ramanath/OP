Mary Kathryn "Heidi" Heitkamp (born October 30, 1955) is the junior United States Senator from North Dakota, in office since 2013, and a member of the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party. She was the 28th North Dakota Attorney General, serving from 1993 to 2001, and State Tax Commissioner from 1989 to 1993.
Heitkamp was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in the 2000 gubernatorial election, losing to John Hoeven. She considered a bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2010 U.S. Senate election to replace retiring Senator Byron Dorgan, but on March 3, 2010, declined the rematch against Hoeven, who was ultimately elected.
In November 2011, Heitkamp declared her candidacy to replace Kent Conrad as U.S. Senator from North Dakota in the 2012 election. She narrowly defeated Republican Congressman Rick Berg on November 6, 2012, in that year's closest Senate race, with Berg conceding the next day. She is North Dakota's second female senator, after Jocelyn Burdick, and the first to be elected.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
Heitkamp was born in Breckenridge, Minnesota, the fourth of seven children of Doreen LaVonne (née Berg) and Raymond Bernard Heitkamp. Her father was of German descent, while her mother is of half Norwegian and half German ancestry. Heitkamp was raised in Mantador, North Dakota. She earned a B.A. from the University of North Dakota in 1977 and a J.D. from Lewis and Clark Law School in 1980.
In 1980-81, she was an attorney for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. She next worked for the Office of the North Dakota State Tax Commissioner as an attorney. In 1986, incumbent State Tax Commissioner Kent Conrad decided to retire in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Heitkamp ran for the position and won the statewide election with 66% of the vote against Republican Marshall Moore. She served in that position until 1992.


== Attorney General ==
In 1992, the incumbent North Dakota Attorney General, Democrat Nick Spaeth, decided to retire in order to run for governor of North Dakota. Heitkamp ran for the position and won with 62% of the vote. In 1996, she won reelection with 64% of the vote.
Heitkamp's best-known achievement as Attorney General of North Dakota was to lead the state's legal efforts against tobacco companies, which resulted in the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. This provides for the tobacco companies to pay the state funds to be applied to health care costs.


== 2000 gubernatorial election ==

In 2000, incumbent Republican Governor Ed Schafer decided not to seek a third term. Heitkamp ran and was unopposed in the primary. On the Republican side, John Hoeven, CEO of Bank of North Dakota, also ran unopposed. During her campaign for governor it was announced that Heitkamp had been diagnosed with breast cancer, which is now in remission. Hoeven defeated her 55% to 45%. Heitkamp won 12 of the state's 53 counties.


== Business career (2001–2011) ==
Heitkamp served as the director of Dakota Gasification Company's Great Plains Synfuels Plant from 2001 to 2012.  Her brother, Joel, is a radio talk-show host and former North Dakota state senator. Heitkamp has occasionally filled in for her brother as host of his program, News and Views, which is broadcast on Clear Channel stations in North Dakota.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== 2012 election ===

In January 2011, incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Kent Conrad announced his intent to retire instead of seeking a fourth full term in 2012. On November 8, 2011, she announced that she would seek the open seat. She vowed to be "an independent voice."
Heitkamp was attacked in commercials for accepting campaign contributions from a trial lawyer, Jack McConnell, Jr., assigned by her to help North Dakota implement its settlement with tobacco companies when she served as state attorney general. She released an ad to respond to these allegations. 
Heitkamp won the November 6, 2012, Senate election by 2,994 votes, less than 1% of the ballots cast. Berg conceded the race the next day. If he had not, the race could have been subject to a "demand recount" under North Dakota law, which permits candidates to demand a recount if they lose an election by more than 0.5% but less than 2% of the vote cast for the candidate receiving the most votes for the office sought. Upon winning the election, Heitkamp became North Dakota's second female U.S. Senator. She serves alongside her former gubernatorial opponent John Hoeven.

== Political positions ==


=== Health care ===
Heitkamp has said that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains "good and bad" and "it needs to be fixed." She criticized her Senate opponent Rick Berg for wanting to repeal the law, citing concerns about insurance companies denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions. Berg and the NRSC criticized Heitkamp for offering unqualified support for the health care law until she ran for the Senate in 2011, citing footage of her at a 2010 rally where she called the bill "a legacy vote" without any criticism of it.
During the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Heitkamp criticized Republican attempts to use the Continuing Appropriations Resolution as "a vehicle to legislate other issues," such as the defunding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a delay of its individual mandate. Heitkamp was one of 14 members of the bipartisan Senate group that negotiated the compromise that was the basis of the eventual deal to end the shutdown. During the government shutdown in 2013 Heitkamp donated about $8,000 of her salary to North Dakota charities that support veterans, provide healthcare supplies to those that cannot afford them, and raise Breast Cancer awareness.


=== Spending ===
Heitkamp said she would support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution "with exceptions" if elected. Heitkamp said such exceptions would include wartime spending, Social Security, Medicare, and a ban on tax cuts for those making more than $1 million per year.


=== Taxes ===
Heitkamp announced in a campaign press release in 2012 that she supports the Buffett Rule. Heitkamp supports implementing the Buffett Rule via the Paying a Fair Share Act, which would require those making a gross income of $1,000,000 or more to pay at least a 30% federal tax rate.


=== Filibuster reform ===
Heitkamp said she supports reforming the filibuster in the United States Senate, but did not specifically endorse the Merkley/Udall/Harkin proposal for doing so.


=== Energy ===
Heitkamp said she supports the Keystone XL pipeline because it will create jobs, decrease America's dependence on foreign oil from the Middle East, and help drive down the national debt. She also said many who oppose hydraulic fracturing have been exposed to "junk science" and do not know what it really is. She was Climate Hawks Vote's lowest-rated Democratic senator on climate leadership in the 113th Congress and remains among the lowest in 2015.


=== Same-sex marriage ===
On April 5, 2013, Heitkamp announced her support of same-sex marriage, along with fellow Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly (D-Indiana), who entered the Senate the same time Heitkamp did. Both are Roman Catholics.


=== Gun control ===
On April 11, 2013, Heitkamp explained in an interview that she intended to vote against the Manchin-Toomey amendment introduced in the Senate after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which would have amended the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to expand background checks to gun shows and internet purchases. Heitkamp said, "I'm going to represent my state. ... in the end it's not what any other senator believes. It's about what the people of North Dakota believe." Polling suggests that the majority of North Dakotans approve of prohibiting individuals on the No-Fly list from buying firearms and ammunition, but in June 2016, after the Orlando nightclub mass shooting, Heitkamp voted against such a prohibition. She was the only Democratic senator to do so. She instead appeared in support of a "compromise gun bill" proposed by Susan Collins.


== Personal life ==
Heitkamp is married to Darwin Lange, a family practitioner. They reside in Mandan and are the parents of two adult children, Ali and Nathan.

** Privatize Social Security **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: Our retirement funds should not be entrusted to the government. The entire Social Security system should be run instead as we currently run IRAs, Keogh plans, 401(k)'s, and other private pension plans. 
  * **Support** means you believe: The Trust Fund might be invested in the stock market or via some other private investment vehicle. Individuals should be given at least some control over how their retirement funds are invested. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Social Security should remain under federal control, but you want reforms on how the Trust Fund is handled. In particular, the `Lockbox Bill' is a good first reform, since it keeps the system secure while avoiding privatization. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Social Security should remain forever under federal control to ensure that all Americans have a secure retirement. The Trust Fund should not be invested in anything like the stock market, since that would introduce undue risk. 

This question is looking for your views on how large a role the federal
government should play in individual retirement. However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Self-management of one's Social Security account 
  * Unlimited contributions to IRAs
  * Allow people to contribute to EITHER Social Security taxes OR their own personal retirement accounts
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of self-determination of one's own retirement funding. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** progress towards market-based retirement funding. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe in **practical** reforms to protect the Trust Fund without any risky investments. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** that government involvement in retirement funding should not be replaced by private entities.

BACKGROUND**

###  Social Security Trust Fund

The Trust Fund is the government's means of saving up for the expected
increase in retirement in coming decades. The primary policy question is where
to invest the fund, and whether to increase the total fund by adding money
from the budget surplus.

  * The Democratic plan is to have the federal government continue to control the investment (which implies investing in Treasury Bills, which means lending to the National Debt). 
  * The Republican plan is to have individually controlled retirement investment accounts (which implies investment in the Stock Market, Bond Market, and Money market) 
  * Alternative plans are to have government-controlled investments in the stock market or other private markets. 

### Social Security retirement age

Increasing the retirement age would increase the Social Security Trust Fund by
delaying the age at which benefits could be received. Full retirement age had
been 65 for many years. However, beginning with people born in 1938 or later,
that age gradually increases. For those born in 1960 or afterwards...

  * At age 62, retirees will get 70% of monthly benefits. 
  * At age 65, retirees will get 86.7% of monthly benefits. 
  * At age 67, retirees will get 100% (full retirement age for full benefits).  

### Social Security Investment

Due to the enormous amount of money involved, where and how the Trust Fund is
invested will dramatically impact the economy.

    
    
    
     $1.0 trillion      Total amount currently in the Trust Fund   (2012)
     $3.0 trillion      Estimated amount needed by peak year       (2015)
     $0.5 trillion      Expected new budget deficit                (2013)
     $3.8 trillion      Total amount of most recent federal budget (2013)
    $14.2 trillion      Total amount of the federal National Debt  (2011)
    $13.4 trillion      Total market capitalization of the NYSE    (2011)
    
     $0.6 trillion      Total amount previously in the Trust Fund  (1999)
     $3.0 trillion      Estimated amount needed by peak year       (2015)
     $2.9 trillion      Expected total budget surplus for years 2000-2009
     $1.8 trillion      Total amount of most recent federal budget (2000)
     $5.6 trillion      Total amount of the federal National Debt  (1998)
    $11.6 trillion      Total market capitalization of the NYSE    (1999)
    

### Lockbox

* The Lockbox Bill aims to protect the future Social Security surplus by removing it from the control of federal budget makers. 
* The vote in Congress was 416-12 in favor of the bill. 
* It would require a super-majority vote on any bill that would add to the budget deficit, which implies borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund. 

### IRAs and other Retirement Accounts

* Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) allow saving $2,000 per year tax-free, to be withdrawn beginning between ages 59 and 71. 
* Keough Plans for self-employed people allow saving $30,000 per year tax-free, to be withdrawn beginning at age 59. 
* Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plans (SAR SEPs), allow investing $6,000 per year tax-free in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or precious metals. 
* 401(k) company-sponsored retirement plans allow investing $30,000 per year tax-free in any investment vehicle, including real estate and insurance. 

### Medicare and Medicaid

* Medicare and Medicaid will become insolvent under current estimates by 2015 (1999 budget discussions may push that to 2025). 
* There were 39 million Medicare beneficiaries in 1998; that number is expected to rise along with Social Security retirement figures. 
* Senior Drug coverage is currently $24-$44 per month insurance premium to cover $1,000-$2,500 per year in drug costs. 
* Medicare deductible on tax returns is currently $100 per year; also expected to rise in current negotiations. 

### Social Security Buzzwords

* The biggest component of the Social Security debate is whether people should be allowed to privately invest their retirement money. Fully doing so has the effect of replacing the Social Security system with a federally-run retirement investment plan. 
* Liberals and populists generally oppose privatization of Social Security. Look for buzzwords like "risky" to describe the stock market component, or "maintain confidence in the Trust Fund" to describe the federally-managed system. 
* Moderate liberals and populists generally favor some components of privatization and pay lip-service to the concept of the stock market. Look for buzzwords like "government investment in the stock market," which means maintaining complete federal control of Social Security while attempting to reap the greater profit of private investment. 
* Conservatives and libertarians generally favor privatization. Look for buzzwords like "personal choice" or "individual control" of one's retirement account (to contrast the lack of individualization of the current Social Security system). 
* Moderate conservatives and libertarians favor privatizing some components while maintaining federal control of the overall system. Look for terms like "increase IRAs" (individual retirement accounts in addition to Social Security accounts); or "Remove the Earnings Test," which means allowing seniors to earn income without diminishing their Social Security payments. 
* Moderates from both the right and left generally support Social Security reform which increase the value of the Trust Fund while still providing benefits to all citizens. Look for terms such as "increase the retirement age," which would increase the Trust Fund by delaying the age at which benefits could be received. 
* Some centrists from both the right and the left support reforms to better account for the Trust Fund, generally by taking it "off-budget" or putting it in a "Lock Box." That refers to the accounting method for Social Security, which does not maintain a separate bottom-line for the Trust Fund but instead assigns its surplus or deficit to general treasury funds. Accounting separately for Social Security would disallow political machinations of the surplus and, in this view, would enhance the future long-term survival of Social Security.
