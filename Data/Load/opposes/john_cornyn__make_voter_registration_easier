John Cornyn III (born February 2, 1952) is the senior United States Senator from Texas, serving since 2002. He is a member of the Republican Party and the current Senate Majority Whip for the 114th Congress. Cornyn previously served as Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 2007 to 2011.
Born in Houston, Cornyn is a graduate from Trinity University and St. Mary's University School of Law, receiving his LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law. Cornyn was a Judge on Texas' 37th District Court from 1985 to 1991, until he was elected an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court, where he served 1991 to 1997. In 1998, Cornyn was elected Attorney General of Texas, serving one term until winning a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2002. He was re-elected to a second term in 2008 and to a third term in 2014.


== Early life, education, and legal career ==
Cornyn was born in Houston, the son of Atholene Gale Cornyn (née Danley) and John Cornyn II, a colonel in the U.S. Air Force. He attended the American School in Japan while growing up when his family moved to Tokyo. He graduated from Trinity University in 1973, where he majored in journalism and was a member of Chi Delta Tau. He earned a J.D. from St. Mary's University School of Law in 1977 and an LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1995. He was named the St. Mary's Distinguished Law School Graduate in 1994 and a Trinity University Distinguished Alumnus in 2001.
He served in San Antonio for six years as a district judge before being elected as a Republican in 1990 to the Texas Supreme Court, on which he served for seven years.

=== 1998 election ===
In 1998 Cornyn decided to run to become Texas Attorney General. In the March primary, Barry Williamson, Railroad Commissioner, placed first with 38% of the vote but failed to get the 50% threshold necessary to win the Republican nomination. Cornyn, then a state Supreme Court Justice, got second place with 32%. In the April run-off election, Cornyn defeated Williamson 58% to 42%. In the general election, Cornyn defeated Jim Mattox, former attorney general (1983–1991) and U.S. Congressman, with 54% of the vote. Cornyn became only the second Republican to hold the position.


=== Accomplishments ===

He created the Texas Internet Bureau to investigate illegal internet practices. He fought against government waste and corruption with his investigation of fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims.
However, Cornyn was criticized for failing to investigate in a timely manner the notorious false drug convictions of numerous African-Americans in Tulia, Texas. An Austin Chronicle article on September 6, 2002, noted, "After months of criticism from civil rights groups and state and national media, state attorney general and U.S. Senate candidate John Cornyn announced that his office will finally investigate the notorious 1999 drug bust in the Panhandle town of Tulia. In most cases, the testimony of a single narcotics agent led to the arrests of 46 people—43 of whom were black. The accused represented 16% of the town's black population; 14 still languish in prisons scattered around Texas".
In 2005 Cornyn's name was mentioned among possibilities to replace Supreme Court justices Sandra Day O'Connor or William Rehnquist.


== United States Senate ==


=== Elections ===
2002

In the 2002 U.S. Senate Primary in Texas, Cornyn was the candidate promoted and supported by the Texas Republican Party. He easily defeated the five other candidates in the Republican Primary while disdaining the opportunity to debate the other candidates. Cornyn defeated his closest Republican challenger, Bruce Rusty Lang, a self-financed Dallas-based international physician, in the Republican Primary election by a ten to one electoral margin. In the 2002 General election, Cornyn defeated Democrat Ron Kirk in a campaign that cost each candidate over $18 million. Cornyn's predecessor, Phil Gramm, resigned early, effective November 30, 2002, so that Senator-Elect Cornyn could take office early, and move into Gramm's office suite in order to begin organizing his staff. Cornyn did not, however, gain seniority, owing to a 1980 Rules Committee policy that no longer gave seniority to senators who entered Congress early for the purpose of gaining advantageous office space.
2008

Texas has not elected a Democrat in a statewide election since 1994, and according to Rasmussen polling, in October 2008 Cornyn had an approval rating of 50%. Texas House of Representatives member/Afghanistan War veteran Rick Noriega secured his place as Cornyn's Democratic challenger in the March 4 primary, beating out opponents Gene Kelly, Ray McMurrey, and Rhett Smith. The same Rasmussen poll showed Cornyn leading Noriega 47% to 43%, suggesting that this race might have proved to be unexpectedly competitive. However, most polls showed a much wider margin. Christian activist Larry Kilgore of Mansfield, was a Republican challenger for the March 2008 primary election, but Cornyn easily won the Republican Primary.
Yvonne Adams Schick was the Libertarian Party's nominee. In addition, the Green Party of Texas sought ballot access for its candidate David B. Collins.
2014

Cornyn succeeded in his reelection in 2014. He is now Senate Majority Whip. He won the Republican primary with 59% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
In 2004 Cornyn co-founded and became the co-chairman of the U.S. Senate India Caucus. Cornyn was selected by his colleagues in December 2006 to be a member of the five-person Republican Senate leadership team as Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.
Cornyn has received various awards and recognitions, including the 2005 Border Texan of the Year Award; the National Child Support Enforcement Association's Children's Champion Award; the American Farm Bureau Federation's Friend of Farm Bureau Award; the Texas Association of Business's (TAB) Fighter for Free Enterprise Award; the National Federation of Independent Business's (NFIB) Guardian of Small Business Award; the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders's (CONLAMIC) Latino Leadership Award; and the Texas Association of Mexican American Chambers of Commerce's (TAMACC) International Leadership Legislative Award; among others.
In 2005 Cornyn gained notice by connecting the Supreme Court's reluctance to hear arguments for sustaining Terri Schiavo's life with the recent murders of Judge Joan Lefkow's husband and mother as well as the courtroom murder of Judge Rowland Barnes. Cornyn said: "I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and building up to the point where some people engage in violence". His statement and a similar one by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay were widely denounced, including by the New York Times. Cornyn later said that he regretted the statement.
In 2005 the Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Cornyn and Senator Patrick Leahy with its first ever Bi-Partisan Leadership Award in honor of their cooperation on issues of government oversight and transparency, including their co-sponsorship of the OPEN Government Act of 2005, which prevented burying exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act in legislation.
Cornyn has been described by Jim Jubak of MSN Money as one of "Big Oil's ten favorite members of Congress", as he has received more money from the oil and gas industry than all but six other members of Congress.
On the day of Obama's inauguration, it was reported that Cornyn would prevent Hillary Rodham Clinton from being confirmed as secretary of state by a unanimous floor vote that day. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's spokesman reported to the Associated Press that a roll call vote would be held instead on the following day, January 21, 2009, for the Clinton confirmation and that it was expected Clinton would "receive overwhelming bipartisan support". The vote was 94–2 in her favor, with only Senators Jim DeMint (R-SC) and David Vitter (R-LA) voting in opposition.
As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Cornyn was a strong supporter of Norm Coleman's various court challenges to the election certification. Cornyn advocated for Coleman to bring the case before the federal court, and had said the trial and appeals could take years to complete. Cornyn had threatened that Republicans would wage a "World War III" if the Senate Democrats had attempted to seat Democratic candidate Al Franken before the appeals were complete. Coleman conceded after the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in favor of Democratic candidate Al Franken. On November 14, 2012, Cornyn was elected Senate minority whip by his peers.
In February 2013, Cornyn became one of the sponsors of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.

== Political positions ==
Cornyn was ranked by National Journal as the fourteenth-most conservative United States Senator in their 2013 rankings. He was considered by The Dallas Morning News to be a reliable ally of former President George W. Bush on most issues.


=== Civil rights and law enforcement ===
In the 2004 debate surrounding the Federal Marriage Amendment, Cornyn released an advance copy of a speech he was to give at the Heritage Foundation. In the speech, he wrote, "It does not affect your daily life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle. But that does not mean it is right... Now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife". According to his office, he removed the reference to the box turtle in the actual speech, but the Washington Post ran the quote, as did The Daily Show.
Cornyn sponsored a bill that would allow law enforcement to force anyone arrested or detained by federal authorities to provide samples of their DNA, which would be recorded in a central database. He voted to recommend a constitutional ban on flag desecration and for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. He also voted for the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act and extending its wiretap provision.


=== Defense and homeland security ===
Cornyn was one of only 22 Senators to vote against the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 that expands the educational benefits for soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, he co-sponsored SB 2938, which gives benefits that are dependent on length of service.
In August 2012, following news reports that a Russian Akula-class nuclear-powered submarine operated in the Gulf of Mexico purportedly undetected for over a month, Cornyn demanded details of this deployment from Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, the Chief of Naval Operations.
In 2013 Cornyn said that, despite the sequester, the Pentagon would actually see its budget increase.


=== Social policy ===
He voted to ban partial-birth abortions except in cases where the mother's life was in danger, and for a criminal penalty for harming a fetus while committing another crime. He also voted in favor of notifying parents of minors who get out-of-state abortions. He voted against expanding research to more embryonic stem cell lines. He voted to prevent contributions to organizations that provide abortion as a component of family planning, and to prevent funding of organizations that support coercive abortion.
Cornyn voted to confirm Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States. In September 2005, during the Supreme Court hearings for Roberts, Cornyn's staff passed out bingo cards to reporters. He asked them to stamp their card every time a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee used terms such as "far right" or "extremist".
On July 24, 2009, Cornyn announced his intention to vote against President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor, citing his opinion that she might rule "from a liberal, activist perspective".


=== Fiscal policy ===
Cornyn voted to permanently repeal the estate tax and for raising the estate tax exemption to $5 million. He voted in favor of $350 billion in tax cuts over 11 years and supports making the George W. Bush tax cuts permanent. However, he stands opposed to extending the 2011 payroll tax holiday.
Cornyn is a cosponsor of the Fair Tax Act of 2007. John Cornyn also voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 but against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009.
In 2005 Cornyn voted against including oil and gas smokestacks in mercury regulations. He voted against factoring global warming into federal project planning, and against banning drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He also voted against removing oil and gas exploration subsidies. During his tenure in the Senate, Cornyn has scored 0% on the League of Conservation Voters' environmental scorecard, a system of ranking politicians according to their voting record on environmental legislation.
Cornyn opposed President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Cornyn stated that Senator Cruz's efforts to defund Obamacare were "unachievable". He also stated: "The shutdown did not help our cause. What did help our cause was the president’s implementation of Obamacare, which has overwhelmed everything else. I don’t hear anyone thinking that another government shutdown is the way to achieve our goals."
Cornyn joined other Republican leaders to block fellow Texas Senator Ted Cruz's procedural move to reject an increase in the debt ceiling.
Cornyn voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in 2008 also known as the Wall Street bailout, and later voted to end the program.


=== Gun rights ===
In April 2013, Senator Cornyn was one of 46 senators to vote against the passing of a bill which would have expanded background checks for all buyers. Cornyn voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop the passage of the bill.
In January 2014, Senator Cornyn introduced the "Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act". The bill would provide interstate reciprocity for persons with concealed weapons permits. Cornyn described the bill as "It’s like a driver’s license. It doesn’t trump state laws. Say you have a carry permit in Texas; then you use it in another state that has a concealed-carry law." He is rated "A" by the National Rifle Association.


=== Victims rights ===
Senator John Cornyn has long been opposed to anyone profiting from memorabilia tied to convicted murderers, and had made three attempts thus far to pass acts against this. He introduced his first "Stop the Sale of Murderabilia to Protect the Dignity of Crime Victims Act" in 2007, which died in committee. He then revived it three years later with cosponsor Amy Klobuchar. The 2010 version of the "Murderabilia" bill met the same fate as the first.
In 2013, inspired by a Nidal Hasan letter put up for sale by artist Kelly Hutchison, Conryn decided to continue working on his bill. The listing claimed that all proceeds would be donated to charity, and the letter was reported to have sold anywhere from $2000 USD to $500,000 USD by various news sources.


== Electoral history ==


== Personal life ==
Cornyn and his wife, the former Sandy Hansen, have two daughters.
Cornyn gained national attention when he released a video referring to himself as "Big Bad John." The video was featured on comedy shows such as The Colbert Report and The Daily Show.
In August 2014, Cornyn was named "Mr. South Texas" for the 118th Washington's Birthday Celebration in Laredo in February 2015. WBCA president Veronica Castillon said that Cornyn "loves Laredo, and it shows through his attention and actions ..."

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Make voter registration easier **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support ** means you believe: 
  * Voter ID laws are racist and intended to suppress minority voting. 
  * More enforcement of right to vote, not enforcement against voters. 
  * Public funds should be used for political campaigns. 
  * The best way to reduce the influence of big-money lobbyists and special interests is to remove as much money as possible from campaigning. Free television time would be a good start. 
  * **Support** means you believe: 
  * Voter ID laws just make it harder for people to vote, and we should work to make it EASIER to vote. 
  * Reforms are needed in campaign finance, in order to reduce the influence of moneyed interests. 
  * Those reforms might include restrictions on personal donations to political campaigns; restrictions on corporate, labor union, or PAC donations; and restrictions on PAC activities. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: 
  * ID requirements for voting are reasonable. 
  * Politicians will always find loopholes in any campaign finance reform, so the best approach is just to monitor campaigns for lawbreaking and leave the rest to the press. Better reporting of donations would be useful. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: 
  * Voter fraud undermines the most fundamental process of democracy, and we need to fight it. 
  * Campaign donations are free speech, and should not be limited for corporations nor for individuals. PACs and 527 committees should be similarly allowed free speech via unlimited spending on any issue or any candidate they choose. 

This question is looking for your views on whether wealthy individuals should
have an unlimited right to finance political candidates (including
themselves). However you answer the above question would be similar to your
response to these statements:

  * Require TV networks to provide free air time to candidates 
  * Stricter limits on political campaign funds 
  * Voter ID laws are racist 
  * Suppressing the vote is incumbency protection 
  * Overturn _Citizens United_ via a Constitutional Amendment 
  * Include a checkoff box on tax returns for optional $1 contributions 
  * Support "Clean Election" laws where candidates receive funding if they agree to spending limits 
  * Restrict PAC (political action committees) spending on individual campaigns. 
  * Restrict the activities of 527 committees (independent fundraising entities such as MoveOn.org or the Swift Boat Veterans committee) 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of taxpayer funding for political campaigns. 
  * **Support** means you believe that restrictions on campaign finance, and/or partial public funding, is a **practical** means to reduce undue political influence. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe some **practical** reforms are needed, but that the basic system of privately financing political campaigns is acceptable. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that the **principle** of free speech applies to political campaign donations. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

**Campaign Finance Reform**
  * "McCain-Feingold" refers to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as BCRA, named after its sponsors, Sen. John McCain (R, AZ) and Sen. Russ Feingold (D, WI). McCain-Feingold doubled the campaign donation limit from $1,000 per person to $2,000 per person ($2,500 in 2012), known as "hard money." The law banned "soft money" contributions to political parties, but later Supreme Court cases, particularly "Citizens United," allowed unlimited soft money for purposes of advertising for or against a candidate as long as there was no "coordination" with the campaign. 

  * Citizens United refers to a 2010 Supreme Court case which allowed unlimited spending by Super-PACs on behalf of any candidate, as long as the TV ads are not coordinated with the campaign itself. Super-PACs dominate the spending in the 2012 presidential primaries. 

  * PAC money means donations to political action committees, which is used for issue ads which typically favor one candidate, but do not count in federal spending limits. 

  * Soft money means donations to the national party rather than to a particular candidate ($193 million in the 1998 election, for example). 

  * Hard money is subject to less reform proposals -- it means cash donations to a particular candidate, which must be fully reported to the FEC. 

  * Individuals may donate a maximum of $1000 to one candidate, but may donate any amount of soft money, and any amount to PACs. 

  * Candidates who volutarily limit their campaign spending qualify for federal matching funds of about $100 million. 

**Earmarks**
  * Earmark Reform" refers to changing the rules of Congress to restrict earmarks," which are currently legal and ethical. 

  * Earmarks" means line items in legislative bills which allocate specific monetary resources to a specific purpose (or to a specific company). 

  * An example is a highway improvement project in a House member's district, buried in a 1,000-page spending bill. 

  * Earmarks have become controversial because, in theory, members of Congress could quietly allocate an earmark that would benefit a campaign donor (known as pork-barrel spending"). 

  * Proposed reforms range from full disclosure (showing every earmark and its originating legislator on a public website) to the Line Item Veto (allowing the President to veto earmarks without vetoing the entire spending bill). 

**Czars**
  * The term "czar" refers to a powerful presidential appointee who is not confirmed by the Senate. In other words, a "czar" is answerable only to the President, unlike normal Cabinet secretaries and other appointees, who must pass the Senate confirmation process. 

  * "Czar" is an informal title used by the press and sometimes by the appointee. For example, [Elizabeth Warren](../Senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm) was known as the "Consumer Czar," but her formal title was "Special Advisor for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau." 

  * Czars were popularized by Pres. Clinton and the czar count increased to several dozen under Pres. George W. Bush and Pres. Obama, but the practice goes back to the 1930s. 

**Term Limits**
  * The Constitution limits the president to two terms, or a total of 10 years. There are not limits for the US House or the US Senate. 

  * In March 1998, the Supreme Court let stand term limits for state lawmakers, but previously ruled that establishing such restrictions nationally would require amending the Constitution. Efforts to limit federal Congressional terms died out in early 1997. 

  * 18 states have laws limiting politicians' terms, and in 1998, more than 200 state legislators were forced to retire. 

  * The latest push is for term limits for judges. The purpose would be to limit Judicial activism, which means establishing new laws from the bench rather than from Congress. 

**Balanced Budget Amendment**
  * In 1998, the Senate defeated by one vote a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the Constitution. It would have mandated an end to deficit spending unless 60% of Congress voted to override. 
  * State budget balancing requirements typically only apply to the _operating budget_ (ongoing expenses), but not to _capital expenditures_ (one-time investments). The proposed BBA restricts both. 
  * The Line Item Veto would be another Constitutional Amendment intended to reduce budget growth, by allowing the President to selectively veto particular spending items. 
  * Corporate welfare restrictions are often addressed in the context of a BBA or Line Item Veto. However, most federal corporate subsidies are embedded in the tax code rather than in the spending side of the budget. 

**Devolution to States**
  * Unfunded Mandates mean that the federal government requires states to undertake activities without providing funding for them. 
  * Block Grants mean that the federal government gives states funds to spend as each state sees fit. 
  * Devolution means the federal government should close departments and agencies, transfer functions to the states, or otherwise yield control over policy which is now federally controlled. The philosophy behind devolving power to the states is based in the 10th Amendment. It is currently appiled primarily to welfare reform. 

**Reinventing Government**
  * Reinvention has been the official policy of the federal government since 1993. The basic concepts are: 
  * Government should steer rather than row (provide a framework for non-government action rather than operate institutions). 
  * Government should focus on outcomes (desired results) and needs of customers (service recipients), rather than inputs (dollars and jobs) and needs of bureaucracies (rules). 
  * Government should decentralize and address problems from the lowest level of government possible; 
  * Public agencies should compete with private agencies, and should adopt a market orientation; 
  * Government which work betters also costs less. 

**Election Reform**
  * The GOP proposed a plan in May 2000, that small states would have primaries first, progressing to larger states over a four-month primary season. 
  * An older proposal is a system of regional primaries with a rotating right to go first. 
  * A constitutional amendment would be required to modify the Electoral College, but not to modify the primaries; many states in 2012 switched their GOP primaries from ['Winner-take-all' to 'Proportional'](../2012_WTA_vs_Proportional.htm).  

**Amendment X to the US Constitution** The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. (1791)
