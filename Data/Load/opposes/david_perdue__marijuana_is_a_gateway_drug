David Alfred Perdue, Jr. (born December 10, 1949) is an American politician who is the junior United States Senator from Georgia, having been elected to the seat previously held by Saxby Chambliss, who retired. Perdue won the most votes in the Republican primary election in Georgia on May 20, 2014, and defeated Representative Jack Kingston in the runoff on July 22, 2014. Perdue defeated Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn on November 4, 2014, and took office on January 3, 2015.


== Early life and education ==
Perdue was born in Macon, Georgia, the son of David Alfred Perdue, Sr., and the former Gervaise Wynn, both schoolteachers. He was raised in Warner Robins, Georgia. He lives with his wife, Bonnie Dunn Perdue, in the resort town of Sea Island. The couple have two sons, David A. Perdue III and Blake Perdue, and three grandchildren. He is the first cousin of former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue.
Perdue has a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering (1972) and a master's degree in operations research (1975), both from Georgia Tech. At Georgia Tech, Perdue was a brother of the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity.


== Business career ==
Perdue began his career at Kurt Salmon Associates, an international consulting firm, where he worked for twelve years as a management consultant. His first major corporate job was as senior vice president of Asia operations for Sara Lee Corporation, a position he took in 1992. His time at Sara Lee was followed by a stint at Haggar Clothing, where he became senior vice president of operations in 1994.
In 1998, Perdue joined Reebok as a senior vice president, eventually rising to president and CEO. Perdue is credited with significantly reducing the company's debt and reviving its sneaker line. Perdue negotiated a contract with the National Football League that a former Reebok executive referred to as "revolutionary" for repositioning the company's shoe brand.
In 2002, Perdue left Reebok for Pillowtex, a North Carolina textile company. The company had recently emerged from bankruptcy with a heavy debt load and an underfunded pension liability. Perdue was unable to obtain additional funding from the company's investors and later was unsuccessful in finding a buyer for the company. He left the company in 2003 after nine months on the job and $1.7 million in compensation. Pillowtex closed several months later, leaving 7,650 workers out of work nationwide. With more than 4,000 jobs lost statewide, it was the largest single day job loss in North Carolina history at the time.
After leaving Pillowtex, Perdue became CEO of Dollar General. Prior to his joining the company, it had recently overstated profits by $100 million and paid $162 million to settle shareholder lawsuits. Perdue overhauled the company's inventory line and logistics network and updated its marketing strategy. After initially closing hundreds of stores, the company doubled its stock price and opened 2,600 new stores before being sold in 2007 to private equity investors.
From 2007 to 2009, Perdue worked as a senior consultant for Indian chemical textile conglomerate Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Ltd. In April 2011, Perdue started an Atlanta-based global trading firm.
According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Perdue is "known on Wall Street as a turnaround specialist who helps revive brands and reap rewards for investors."

=== 2014 Senate campaign ===

Perdue touted his business experience, and particularly his experience at Dollar General, in running for office. According to Perdue: "We added about 2,200 stores, created almost 20,000 jobs and doubled the value of that company in a very short period of time. Not because of me, but because we listened to our customers and employees.‚Äù He received the endorsement of the National Federation of Independent Business.
Perdue's political opponents targeted his business career during the campaign, specifically for outsourcing work, which Perdue stated he was "proud of", and for the job losses that followed the final closure of Pillowtex. After being elected, Perdue stated that he wanted to bring the perspective of a working person to Washington D.C.
The race was considered to be a competitive race. Perdue won the general election, defeating the Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn 52.89% to 45.21%.

Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry
Subcommittee on Commodities, Markets, Trade and Risk Management
Subcommittee on Conservation, Forestry and Natural Resources (Chair)

== Political positions ==
Perdue stated that he entered politics out of concern for the rising national debt. He supports repealing and replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He also supports a constitutional balanced budget amendment and comprehensive tax reform. In addition, he pledged to limit himself to two terms in the Senate, equivalent to 12 years.
In October 2015, Perdue voted in favor of the CISA (Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act), despite strong opposition from major companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Twitter. This is consistent with his record of a "Common Defense" as he also supported the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act).
In a June 2016 speech to a conference of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, Perdue urged the audience to pray for President Obama's "days to be short".

** Marijuana is a gateway drug **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: Drug use is immoral and drugs poison our youth and our society. We should fight the Drug War using all reasonable means - Just Say No! 
  * **Support** means you believe: The Drug War is winnable if we invest enough resources. We should do whatever we have to do: More police, more border patrols, more intervention abroad, more prison terms, more prisons. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: We should have regulated decriminalization. Medical marijuana might be legalized, for example, as might clean hypodermic needles. Our drug policy should be reformed, with less criminal penalties and more drug abuse clinics. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: The Drug War should be ended. It has failed, condemning a 'Lost Generation' of blacks and Hispanics to prison and criminal records. End it now like we ended alcohol Prohibition, and organized crime and drug-related crime will decrease like it did when Prohibition ended. 

This question is looking for your views on the War on Drugs.  However you
answer the above question would be similar to your response to these
statements:

  * Never legalize marijuana 
  * Punish Drug Users 
  * Support and win the War on Drugs 
  * Marijuana usage leads to cocaine &amp; narcotics usage 
  * Permanently ban medicinal marijuana 
  * Use the Army and/or the Coast Guard to stop drugs at our borders 
  * Just Say No! 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe that drug use in wrong on **principle**, and that drug users should therefore be punished. 
  * **Support** means you believe in the postive **practical** effects of reduced drug use. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe the **practical** benefits of reduced restrictions outweigh the costs of incarceration. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that the **principle** of personal decision-making applies to recreational drug use.

****BACKGROUND**

**War on Drugs**

2012 Drug War updated topics:

  * Industrial hemp is a raw material commonly used for making paper, textiles, and other commercial products. In the United States, use of industrial hemp is banned because the plant is related to marijuana. Advocates of drug legalization push the issue of industrial hemp (and wear T-shorts made of industrial hemp) because it is a marginal issue that might gain support from moderates. 

  * Medical marijuana is legal or partially legal in 18 states as of 2012: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. Medical marijuana is also legal in numerous foreign countries. Medical marijuana alleviates symptoms associated with glaucoma, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and numerous mental diseases. 

  * The U.S. "partnership with Colombia" refers to the U.S. policy called "Plan Colombia." Under Plan Colombia, the U.S. provides international aid to the government of Colombia in exchange for aerial spraying of cocaine crops and other anti-narcotic activities. Opponents describe "Plan Colombia" as a disguised means of supporting the right-wing government of Colombia, and destroying local farmers to get at the left-wing rebels known as FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). 

  * In March 2012, religious broadcaster Pat Robertson said the governments war on drugs has failed and so marijuana should be legalized and treated like alcohol. Robertson said, Folks, we've gotta do something about this. We've just got to change the laws. We cannot allow this to continue. It is sapping our vitality. Think of this great land of freedom, he said last week as host of The 700 Club on the Christian Broadcasting Network based in Virginia Beach, Va. 

  * **_Operation Fast and Furious**_ refers to a federal ATF program that put guns in the hands of illicit gun purchasers as a way to track Mexican drug cartels. As a result of the program, hundreds of guns showed up in Mexico and one was found at where a U.S. border agent, Brian Terry, was killed. Attorney General Eric Holder was subpoenaed by Congress to testify on Operation Fast and Furious; Pres. Obama claimed executive privilege; and Congress found Holder in contempt, the first time ever for an Attorney General.  
President Bush Senior initiated the War on Drugs in the late 1980s. The Office
of National Drug Control Policy, directed by Drug Czar  Gil Kerlikowske , sets
federal policy. The updated 2008 drug strategy includes:

  * Stopping Drug Use Before It Starts; 
  * Intervening and Healing Americas Drug Users; 
  * Tackling Transnational Threats; 
  * Disrupting the Market for Illicit Drugs; 
  * Ending illegal sales of controlled substances on the Internet.  
The 2008 policy updates the basic 1999 drug policy, which includes:

  * Expanding drug prevention and drug treatment; 
  * Establishing drug courts and fighting drug legalization; 
  * Focusing on cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine; 
  * Increasing border shielding.
Obama's Drug Czar has called for an end to the War on Drugs, but as of 2012,
the only serious changes are rhetorical.

Background information:

  * Drug offenders who serve jail time or traditional probation have a recidivism rate of 45%. Of those who completed drug courts monitored treatment programs, the rate was 4%. 
  * In April 2000, Hawaii's legislature passed a law permitting people to use marijuana as a medical treatment for AIDS, glaucoma, epilepsy, and to alleviate cancer chemotherapy side-effects. There are five other states in which voters have passed initiatives permitting restricted medical use of marijuana, but Hawaii is the first state to enact a law. Users will be able to grow their own marijuana, limited to six plants. 
  * 60% of federal prison inmates are drug offenders, as are 22% of state prisoners. 
  * 20% of all felony convictions are for drug trafficking; another 12% are for drug possession. 
  * About 270,000 people are incarcerated on drug charges, up from 48,000 at the start of the Drug War. 
  * Direct federal spending on the Drug War is currently $17 billion per year. 
  
**Reducing the Demand** Methods of reducing drug demand include: random drug testing; increased incarceration of users; and drug education. Since 1986, the courts have upheld random drug testing for federal employees; high school students; job applicants; transportation employees; motorists; and others. The current stated federal goal is a Drug-Free Workplace.   
**Reducing the Supply** Methods of reducing drug supply include: increased border patrols; increased enforcement against drug traffickers at home; and pressuring Latin American countries to do the same abroad. Federal counterdrug interdiction currently focuses on five High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas: Los Angeles, New York City, Miami, Houston, and the Southwest border with Mexico.   
**Reducing the Effects** Methods of reducing drugs effects on society include: legalization; drug abuse treatment; and needle exchange programs. At congressional hearings on The Pros and Cons of Drug Legalization, Decriminalization, and Harm Reduction in June 1999, the federal government reiterated its opposition to legalization, medical marijuana, and needle exchanges, and emphasized that the War on Drugs is an unending effort.   
**Drug War Buzzwords**

  * The biggest components of the drug debate is how to reduce drug usage: by prevention or by punishment. 
  * Hard-line liberals and libertarians generally favor legalization. Look for buzz-phrases like "the failed Drug War" or "allow medical marijuana." 
  * Moderate liberals and libertarians will generally favor prevention of drug abuse. Look for buzzwords like "more treatment" or "reduce demand." 
  * Describing drug use as a health problem (instead of a crime problem) is a buzzword for treatment. Seeking to reduce "prison overcrowding" by means such as "drug courts" (as opposed to building more prisons) is a call for drug tolerance or legalization. 
  * Conservatives and populists generally favor punishment for all aspects of the Drug War. Look for buzzwords like "death penalty for drug dealers" or "the scourge of drugs." 
  * Moderate conservatives and populists favor punishment while paying lip-service to other aspects of dealing with drugs. Look for buzzwords like "reduce drug supply" or "protect our borders." 
  * Centrists nowadays are Drug War advocates -- the New Democrats (led by Clinton and Gore) support maintaining funding for the War on Drugs. 
  * Equating alcoholism with drug abuse is a buzzword for marijuana legalization, as is pointing out the hypocrisy of respecting the right of self-harm with alcohol but not of self-harm with drugs. 
  
**Amendment XVIII and XXI to the US Constitution** 18) ...the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors... is hereby prohibited. (1919)   
21) The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United
States is hereby repealed.... (1933)
