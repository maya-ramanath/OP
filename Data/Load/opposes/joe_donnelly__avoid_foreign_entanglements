Joseph Simon "Joe" Donnelly, Sr. (born September 29, 1955) is an American politician who is the junior United States Senator from Indiana. A member of the Democratic Party, Donnelly has served in the Senate since January 3, 2013.
Born in Massapequa, New York, Donnelly graduated from The University of Notre Dame. He began his career serving on the Indiana State Election Board before working as an attorney in practice. From 1997 to 2001, he was a member of the Mishawaka Marian School Board, serving as the board's President from 2000 to 2001. In 2004, Donnelly ran for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing to Republican incumbent Chris Chocola in the general election. He challenged Chocola to a rematch in 2006, prevailing in the general election and earning 54% of the vote. He was elected to a total of three terms, winning reelection in 2008 and 2010; representing Indiana's 2nd congressional district from 2007 to 2013.
In May 2011, Donnelly announced his intentions to run for the U.S. Senate, winning the Democratic nomination one year later in an uncontested primary. He faced Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, who had defeated 36-year incumbent Richard Lugar in the Republican primary. On November 6, 2012 Donnelly defeated Mourdock in the general election, securing 50% of the vote to Mourdock's 44%.


== Early life, education, and law career ==
Donnelly was born and raised on the South Shore of Long Island in Massapequa, New York. Donnelly moved to South Bend, Indiana in 1973 when he was accepted into the University of Notre Dame, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Government in 1977, and earned his Juris Doctor from Notre Dame Law School in 1981. He practiced law at the Nemeth, Feeney and Masters law firm until 1996, when he opened Marking Solutions, a printing and rubber-stamp company.


== Early political career ==
Donnelly held one public and one private position before deciding to run for U.S. Congress. From 1988 to 1989 he served on the Indiana State Election Board, which was charged with ensuring accurate election results. He served on the Marian High School Board from 1997 to 2001, serving as president of the board of the Catholic school from 2000 to 2001.
He ran a campaign for Indiana Attorney General in 1988, but lost at the Democratic state convention. He also ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Indiana Senate in 1990.
In 2004, Donnelly ran for Indiana's 2nd congressional district. He won the Democratic nomination unopposed. Incumbent Republican Chris Chocola was helped by several fundraising visits from President George W. Bush, and was able to outspend Donnelly by a two to one margin, $1.4 million to $700,000. Donnelly lost the election, 54%–45%. Due to his relatively late entrance into the contest, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) did not offer much support to Donnelly's 2004 campaign. This would change in 2006, when the race was identified by the DCCC as a "Red-to-Blue" contest and extra funds were sent from out of the district in an effort to win back control of the House of Representatives.

=== Elections ===
2006

On May 2, 2006, Donnelly defeated Steve Francis for the Democratic nomination, setting up a rematch against Chris Chocola. Because Chocola was a strong supporter of George W. Bush, the race was expected to be more competitive than in 2004 in light of Bush's waning popularity. The website Moveon.org identified Donnelly as a top contender to defeat a Republican incumbent in the house, and began running its "Red-Handed" ads against Chocola early in the campaign. Chocola still maintained a significant money advantage over Donnelly, but in 2006, Donnelly had enough to maintain a competitive advertising presence throughout the campaign. The campaign was heated, with the DCCC sponsoring ads attacking Chocola as being beholden to moneyed interests in the insurance, pharmaceutical, and energy industries. Chocola returned fire by attacking Donnelly over a late tax filing and by attempting to link him to liberal House leader Nancy Pelosi.
On November 7, 2006, Donnelly defeated Chocola 54%-46%, a difference of 15,145 votes. The key difference between the 2006 and 2004 elections for Donnelly lay in the results within St. Joseph County, the location of South Bend and by far the largest county in the district. Donnelly won that county with 58% of vote, generating a 14,000-vote margin.
2008

Donnelly ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. In the general election, he won re-election to a second term with 67% of the vote.
2010

Donnelly ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. In the general election, he was challenged by Republican nominee State Representative Jackie Walorski. Despite the Republican wave in the 2010 midterm elections, Donnelly won re-election to a third term, defeating Walorski 48%-46%.


=== Tenure ===
Donnelly was named to the House Financial Services Committee for the 110th Congress.
In the House, Donnelly was a member of Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate Democrats. In March 2007, he was recognized as "Blue Dog of the Week" for his work on helping small businesses. He broke with the Democratic leadership on several budgetary issues, including the 2008 fiscal budget proposal. In June 2007, he was ranked as one of the ten most independent Democrats by a Congressional Quarterly report.

=== 2012 election ===

On May 8, 2012 Donnelly ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. He faced Tea Party favorite, Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, who defeated 6 term incumbent Richard Lugar in the Republican primary, and Libertarian nominee Andy Horning.
During the election, Donnelly framed Mourdock as "the Wall Street candidate," saying that "the difference between me and Mourdock is, I represent the middle class, while he represents the special interests." Donnelly said he would bring "Hoosier common sense" to the Senate while Mourdock would only "contribute to partisan gridlock".
Donnelly's Senate campaign also focused on closing tax loopholes for corporations, cutting taxes on small businesses, investing in American energy production, and cutting spending to balance the national budget. Donnelly was endorsed by every major newspaper in Indiana, and the Louisville Courier Journal, whose readership extends into southern Indiana.
During the campaign Mourdock became embroiled in a controversy after stating that pregnancy from rape is "something that God intended." His remarks were made during a debate on October 23, 2012 while explaining his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape.
On November 6, 2012 Donnelly defeated Mourdock 50%-44%.


=== Tenure ===
On January 3, 2013, Donnelly was sworn into the United State Senate in the 113th Congress by Vice President Joe Biden. Donnelly is first Democrat to hold this seat since Vance Hartke was defeated by Richard Lugar in 1977. Donnelly has said that he will continue the “common-sense Hoosier tradition of Richard Lugar and Evan Bayh.” Matt Tully praised him for his willingness to reach across the aisle. Donnelly has also received praise from his predecessor Richard Lugar for his bipartisan efforts in the Senate. The Lugar Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that was founded by Senator Lugar in 2013, released a Bipartisan Index in cooperation with Georgetown University, ranking Donnelly as the #2 most bipartisan member of the 114th Congress.

=== Economic policy ===
Taxes
In 2007, Donnelly cosponsored the SAFE Commission Act, calling for a commission to develop legislation designed to reform tax policy and entitlement benefit programs. He also supported attempts in the House to patch the Alternative Minimum Tax, and co-sponsored H.R. 976, The Small Business Tax Relief, Act.
In February 2009, Donnelly voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, stating that it would increase the US's economic competitiveness.
Donnelly voted against the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 (a two-month extension of an expiring provision from the American Recovery Act, forestalling an increase in the payroll tax from 4.2% to 6.2%); he voted for the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (a one-year extension of the same provision). In 2012 Donnelly also voted for H.R. 9, the Small Business Tax Cut Act, which would allow businesses with fewer than 500 employees to receive a tax deduction equal to 20% of their domestic business income.
Donnelly was one of 276 members of Congress who voted for the Tax Relief and Unemployment Insurance Act of 2010, extending the 2001 and 2003 Bush-era tax cuts and a 13-month extension of unemployment benefits. In an interview, Donnelly said that he favors making the tax cuts permanent for middle-class Americans and temporarily extending the cuts for families making at least $250,000. During a speech at the 2012 Indiana Democratic Convention, Donnelly said that he would support a temporary one-year extension of all Bush-era tax cuts, declaring "Given our continued economic challenges, now is the time to keep tax rates low, the last thing our economy can afford is more uncertainty. We need to create jobs, we need to help the middle class and support small businesses, and we need to avoid partisan bickering and delay."
Wall Street regulation
During his second term, Donnelly voted for the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Donnelly helped write three amendements to the final bill; Amendment 1; Helps provide adequate tools to a new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission division that regulates credit rating agencies. Amendment 2; Prevents the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) from being used in the future to purchase equity shares of troubled banks as a rescue attempt, and ensuring that the FDIC is used only to protect customers' savings. Amendment 3; Prohibits the Consumer Financial Protection Agency to act on manufactured housing retailers.
In a March 2012 letter Donnelly signed with Democratic members of the House and Senate, he urged Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler to curb oil speculation in the commodity market through new provisions in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Which, according to a publication from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, oil speculators dominate 80% of the energy futures market and adds $.56 per gallon of gas. In the letter to the Chairman, it read: "We have a responsibility to ensure that the price of gas is no longer allowed to be driven up by the same Wall Street speculators who caused the devastating recession that working families are now experiencing. The CFTC must do what the law mandates and end excessive oil speculation."
In July 2012 Donnelly voted in favor of H.R. 459, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, sponsored by Texas Congressman Ron Paul. The bill requires a full audit of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and Federal reserve banks by the Comptroller General. H.R. 459 is now pending before the Senate.
Labor issues
Donnelly has supported increases in the minimum wage and protection of collective bargaining. In Donnelly's first term he co-sponsored H.R. 2: The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. The act allows Congress to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25, and cuts taxes on small businesses by $12 Billion. After The Fair Minimum Wage Act was signed, Donnelly said in a statement that, “A decent wage is essential for a working family to get by in America. This is not only good social and economic policy, it's just plain fair.” Donnelly voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The law was based after the Supreme Court case Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., when the court decided employers cannot be sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 over gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer 180 days ago or more, The Fair Pay Act amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allowing women to file a lawsuit against their employer if they are paid less than men for doing the same work.


=== Veterans ===

Serving on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Donnelly supported the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Appropriations bill, increasing VA funding by $4 Billion, it was the largest funding increase for the in U.S. history. Since taking office, he has worked to improve the conditions at Walter Reed Hospital by supporting H.R.1538, The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act.
He has worked across the aisle with Congressman Fred Upton (R-MI) to introduce H.R. 1490, The Fairness in Veterans Disability Benefits Act, which reduces waiting time for veterans deserving disability benefits. Donnelly has introduced legislation to create a rural advisory board for veterans aiming to improve private-care options for veterans struck with traumatic brain injury.
Donnelly joined Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) in offering an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 that would enhance the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The amendment would protect service members and their families from improper foreclosures, evictions, and other negative financial consequences of military service. He has also worked to open outpatient clinics in South Bend, Indiana and Elkhart, Indiana.


=== Health care ===
Health care reform
In March 2010, Donnelly voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act). Donnelly has said that it is fully funded.
On September 27, 2013, Donnelly voted to restore funding for the Affordable Care Act as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days, and which also omitted House-passed language prioritizing debt payments if Congress fails to increase the nation’s borrowing limits.
Donnelly has voted to requiring insurance companies to expand coverage, and to cover children on their parents' health insurance plan until they're 26. He has also voted to prohibit health insurance companies from Denying coverage to patients with Pre-existing conditions, charging women more than men on health insurance premiums, and establishing an annual and lifetime cap on insurance payments to individuals. Donnelly has also voted to expand Medicare and Medicaid coverage and eligibility. Donnelly has supported the Hyde Amendment of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits federal funding from being used on abortions other than in cases of incest and rape.
Donnelly has said that the Affordable Care Act can be improved. He has proposed changing the act's definition of full-time work from 30 hours a week to 40. Donnelly has also advocated repealing the medical device excise tax (a 2.3% tax on the sale of certain medical devices by the manufacturer, producer or importer of the device). In 2012 Donnelly cosponsored The Protect Medical Innovation Act, which would repeal the tax. When asked about the tax, Donnelly said that, “We fought very hard to keep the medical-device tax out of the bill, and the pledge was we will continue to fight very hard to have it removed." On September 30, 2013, Donnelly voted to remove a provision which would repeal the medical device tax from a government funding bill in opposition to the provision being used as a condition in keeping the government open.
Children's Health Insurance Program
In 2007 Donnelly was a cosponsor of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIP). Appropriating over $60 billion over 5 years by matching federal funds to states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because the Congress has chosen to send me a bill that moves our health care system in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with raising taxes on cigarettes, a new provision was added to raise taxes on other tobacco products.
Prescription drug coverage
Donnelly, along with 197 members of the House, was a cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007.

Libya
In 2011 Donnelly voted to allow Department of Defense funds to be used for military actions in support of the NATO Intervention in Libya. Donnelly also voted in support of the failed resolution to authorize the President to continue the limited use of U.S. Forces in Libya. The resolution stated that Congress does not support deploying, establishing, or maintaining the presence of units and members of U.S. Armed Forces on the ground in Libya unless the purpose of the presence is limited to the defense of U.S. government officials or NATO member forces from imminent danger.
Iraq
Donnelly voted against the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. In addition, in July 2007, Donnelly joined 221 other House members in voting for HR 2956, the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. This legislation contained a deadline for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.
Afghanistan
In 2011 Donnelly aligned himself with Republicans and 7 other members of the Blue Dog coalition in a 204-215 house vote against an accelerated withdrawal from the war in Afghanistan. Donnelly reaffirmed opposition to an accelerated withdrawal from Afghanistan in voting against the Lee amendment, proposed in H.R. 4310, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. The Lee amendment, if passed, would have prohibited the military spending any money in Afghanistan except for non-combat humanitarian activities, and on activities leading to the withdrawal of American military forces from the country.


=== National security ===
Donnelly is a staunch supporter of Defense spending and has a consistent record of voting with conservatives in spending increases in the Department of Defense and Homeland Security. In 2011 Donnelly voted against H.R. 2219 which would have cut the U.S. military budget by $8.5 billion, stipulating that no cuts were to be taken from pay or benefit programs supporting members and veterans of the armed forces. These cuts would have reduced the emphasis of the U.S. budget on weapons programs. Donnelly also voted against the failed Polis amendment, cutting $640 Million in a 2% across-the-board reduction in spending from the 2012 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. Donnelly voted in favor of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act.

Donnelly has voted in support of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act, and requiring FISA warrants for wiretaps in the U.S., but not abroad.


=== Immigration ===
Donnelly voted against the DREAM Act on December 8, 2010. The interest groups English First, Federation for American Immigration Reform, and Americans for a Better Immigration have all been supporters of Donnelly's work, while the National Latino Congreso has adamantly criticized his efforts.

Donnelly helped promote a project that would get rid of gun registration and the trigger lock law in Washington, DC. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has disapproved of Donnelly's views and actions since 1998, based on his gun control voting records. Donnelly was one of seventeen Democrats in the U.S. House to vote with the Republican majority for the criminal Contempt of Congress measure against United States Attorney General Eric Holder in the aftermath of Operation Fast and Furious. More recently, Donnelly has expressed support for background checks for all gun purchases. On April 17, 2013, Donnelly joined three other Senate Democrats in voting against the proposed ban on assault weapons [7].


=== Abortion ===
Donnelly is morally opposed to abortion and is trying to make adoption more accessible to families. On the issue of abortion Donnelly said “As a pro-life congressman, I am committed to protecting life at all stages.” In 2011, he co-sponsored HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. The bill contained an exception for "forcible rape," which opponents criticized as potentially excluding drug-facilitated rape, date rape, and other forms of rape. The bill also allowed an exception for minors who are victims of incest.
In 2011 Donnelly received a 20% rating from abortion rights political action group NARAL. Before 2011, Donnelly had consistently received a 0% rating every year from NARAL during his time in the House. Donnelly has received high scores from the pro-life group National Right to Life Committee, never receiving a rating lower than 70%. In August 2015, Donnelly was one of only two Democratic senators who voted to defund Planned Parenthood, the other senator being Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Avoid foreign entanglements **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe: The United States never should have invaded Iraq; we should not make the same mistake with Iran. 
  * **Support** means you believe: The US should stay out of Iraq & Iran, and should exit Afghanistan as soon as possible, because there is no further military solution in any of those countries. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: We must prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. We should leave Afghanistan only when they can defend themselves. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: We should keep military action on the table for Iran, and we should prepare for that military action seriously. Same for North Korea and others who oppose American national interests. 

This question is looking for your views on the US military role abroad.
However you answer the above question would be similar to your response to
these statements:

  * Stay out of Iran 
  * Invading Iraq was wrong; we never should have gone there, and we still have bases in the region that should be shut. 
  * President Bush lied to the American people about WMDs in Iraq, and we should not trust the same about Iran. 
  * The war in Afghanistan might have been justified, but staying there for over a decade was not. 
  * Al Qaeda outlines a legitimate complaint about U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia. 
  * President Ahmedinejad might be a bad leader, but it is none of our business. 
  * If Israel faces an existential threat from Iran, let Israel deal with them, not the U.S. 
  * Guantanamo prison should be closed immediately. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you oppose the **principle** of pre-emptive war. If we over-extend U.S. hegemony overseas, we will fall in the manner that all empires fall. 
  * **Support** means you believe in avoiding wars for **practical** reasons: they are expensive and cost lives, and we often don't achieve the intended goal. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe there are serious **practical** uses of American military force, for clearly-defined objectives. Those objectives include a secure oil supply, which means our national interest includes ensuring stability in Iraq and Iran. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of pre-emptive war. It is the right of the United States to take military action abroad when we determine our national interest is threatened.

#### The War on Terrorism

[![](../images/afghanMap_detail.gif)](../images/afghanMap_detail.gif)

  * On **Sept. 11, 2001**, terrorists hijacked four commercial jets from Boston and Washington, and flew them into the World Trade Center in NYC and the Pentagon outside DC, destroying the Twin Towers and killing over 6,000 people. It was the worst terrorist incident in history. 
  * Pres. Bush appointed Tom Ridge as the "terrorism czar," formally creating a cabinet-level post for a new **Office of Homeland Security**, initially funding it with $40 billion. 
  * NATO invoked **Article 5** of its charter, which commits 18 European allies to military action in response to an attack on the homeland of the US. 
  * The primary suspect is **Osama bin Laden**, an exiled Saudi millionaire based in Afghanistan. 
  * The CIA formerly funded bin Laden as a leader of the **mujaheddin**, or freedom fighters, when the Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan through the 1980s. 
  * Bin Laden turned against the US when troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War in 1990. He issued a **fatwa**, or religious edict, calling for the removal of US troops from the Holy Lands of Mecca and Medina. 
  * Bin Laden's organization, **al Qaeda**, which means "The Base," funds terrorist training and operations, and has been implicated in past terrorist actions in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 2000 USS Cole bombing, and the 1998 simultaneous attack on two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
  * The US responded to the embassy bombings by a **cruise-missile attack** aimed at bin Laden, terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and chemical factories in Sudan. The US also by indicting bin Laden in US criminal court. 
  * **The Taliban** is the Muslim fundamentalist political party which rules most of Afghanistan. They were the largest army of the mujaheddin, and were also funded by the CIA in the 1980s. Their leader is Mullah Mohammad Omar. 
  * The Taliban rules under **Shari'ah**, or Islamic law as described in the Koran, which implies strict interpretation of moral codes and numerous personal restrictions. 
  * A portion of Afghanistan is ruled by the **Northern Alliance**, another mujaheddin group. Their leader was assassinated in the week preceding the World Trade Center attack; it is unknown whether there was a connection. 
  * The exiled king of Afghanistan, **Muhammad Zahir Shah,** has agreed to participate in a coalition government if the Taliban is overthrown. King Zahir is 86 years old, and has resided in Rome since 1973. 
  * Afghanistan's neighbors are: 
    * Pakistan (which shares the Afghan ethnicity of Pashtun in its northern provinces); 
    * Iran (which shares the Northern Alliance's religion of Shi'a Islam); 
    * Tajikistan (a former Soviet republic, which also has a Shi'a minority); 
    * Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (two other former Soviet republics; they are majority Sunni Muslim, like the Taliban); 
    * and China (bordering its Muslim province, known as Xinjiang in Chinese and Uighurstan in Arabic, where there are regular Islamic uprisings). 
  * The Taliban is recognized only by Pakistan; Saudi Arabia and Yemen, the only other countries to have recognized the Taliban, severed diplomatic ties in late September. 
  * **Pakistan** supplied the mujaheddin before and after the Soviet occupation. Complicating relations with the US, Pakistan exploded a nuclear device in 1998, in response to India's doing so. India and Pakistan have been fighting a sporadic war for decades over the Kashmir region.

#### History of Yugoslavia

[![](../images/YUGO_MAP.JPG)](../images/YUGO_BIG.JPG) Yugoslavia was created
after WWI, from a federation of Balkan countries. The intention was avoiding
further Balkan wars like those which ignited WWI. After WWII, its borders were
redrawn with six republics plus two provinces within Serbia. (click on the map
below left for an [enlarged view](YUGO_BIG.JPG)).

#### Sovereignty

The six Yugoslav republics (see below) have all had history as independent
nations. The two provinces within Serbia (Kosovo and Vojvodina) were never
independent, with legal status like California within the US. Hence much of
the debate on Kosovo centers on 'sovereignty' -- attacking Kosovo can be
viewed as an attack on the sovereignty of Serbia while it was involved in a
Civil War. Bosnia, on the other hand, had autonomous legal status like Puerto
Rico within the US. Bosnia had declared independence from Serbia before the US
sent troops there, and hence sovereignty was not an issue.

#### Marshal Tito

Marshal Tito was the Communist leader of Yugoslavia since WWII. He is credited
with holding the Yugoslav republics together (by dictatorial force), and after
he died in 1980 the republics began to clamor for more autonomy. Further
pressure for independence came from the fall of the Soviet empire in 1989.

#### Breakup of Yugoslavia

In 1990, a new Yugoslav Constitution was enacted. Four republics soon declared
independence, leaving 'Rump Yugoslavia' as only Serbia plus Montenegro. Status
of the former Yugoslav republics and provinces:

    1. **_Slovenia: **_ Declared independence in June 1991; one-week war with Serbia (a 'bloodless' war because Serbia focused on Croatia); Slovenia is now a prospering nation with hopes of joining NATO. 
    2. **_Croatia: **_ Declared independence in June 1991; longer war with Serbia; heavily involved with Bosnia war. 
    3. **_Macedonia: **_ Declared independence in Nov. 1991; avoided war because of arrival of international forces (including US forces, which are still based there). Greece has blocked full international recognition because the name 'Macedonia' is also the name of a Greek province. 
    4. **_Bosnia-Herzegovina: **_ Declared independence in 1992; lengthy war with Serbia and Croatia, with all three countries involved in 'ethnic cleansing.' The war ended with the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. US forces are still stationed in Bosnia, which is partitioned into three ethnic regions (Serb, Bosnian, & Croat). 
    5. **_Montenegro: **_ Still part of Yugoslavia as an autonomous Republic. Montenegrins are ethnically identical to Serbs; they differ only by geography. But in the wake of the Kosovo war, Montenegro may declare independence. 
    6. **_Serbia: **_ Legally, Serbia is just one republic of Yugoslavia. But the Serbs have always been the dominant group in all of Yugoslavia since is formation. 
    7. **_Kosovo: **_ Remains a province within the republic of Serbia. Its population is 3/4 Albanian (referred to as 'ethnic Albanians' to differentiate from residents of the neighboring country of Albania). 
    8. **_Vojvodina: **_ Also remains a province within the republic of Serbia. Its population is 1/2 Hungarian (they border Hungary, and prior to WWII were part of that country). 

#### Slobodan Milosevic

  * Milosevic came to power as Chairman of the Communist Party in 1986. 
  * His popularity increased greatly in 1987 after a speech in Kosovo strongly advocating Serbian nationalism (the speech was made on the site of a 14th century battlefield. This is the political basis for Milosevic not granting Kosovo independence). 
  * Milosevic was democratically elected President of Serbia in 1989, and elected as President of Yugoslavia in 1997. 
  * He was indicted as a war criminal in June 1999, the first time a sitting President has been indicted. His alleged crimes include genocide and ethnic cleansing. 
  * In October 2000, Milosevic lost the presidential election to Vlajislav Kostunica. Milosevic gave up power after widespread protests and Russian urging. 
  * In April 2001, Milosevic surrendered to Serbian government forces. He faces extradition to an international tribunal as well as domestic charges. 

#### Religion and Ethnicity

The major religious divisions in Yugoslavia explain much of the political
divisions:

  * _**Eastern Orthodoxy **_ is the religion of the Serbs, Macedonians, and Montenegrins. Hence Russia (who are also Eastern Orthodox and ethnically Slavic) support the Serbs, and Greece (who consider Macedonians ethnically Greek) identifies with Macedonia. 
  * _**Roman Catholicism **_ is the religion of the Croats, Slovenes, and Hungarians. Hence Croatia and Slovenia are religiously distinct from Serbia even though they are all ethnically Slavic. 
  * _**Islam **_ is the religion of the Bosnians and the Albanians (including those in Kosovo). Hence the country of Bosnia-Herzegovina is all ethnically Slavic but has three distinct religious groups. 

#### Kosovo

In 1999, the US and NATO negotiated with Milosevic in Rambouillet, France,
attempting to resolve the Kosovo crisis without ethnic cleansing or war. The
goal was to be a 'Rambouillet Agreement' fashioned after the Dayton Agreement
that ended the war in Bosnia. The peace talks failed, and NATO bombed Serbia
and Kosovo from March to June 1999. Milosevic capitulated; the Serbian Army
left Kosovo; and NATO, Russian, and UN troops are now stationed there under
the 'KFOR' banner.

#### Israel & Palestine

[![](../images/Israel_Map.gif)](../images/Israel_Map.gif)

  * 1948: The UN partitioned British Palestine into a Jewish state (Israel) and an Arab state (Palestine). Six Arab countries declared war on Israel; Israel survived with borders different than those drawn by the UN; these are now known as the "pre-1967 borders." Palestine did not survive; the East Bank and West Bank of the Jordan River were taken over by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip was taken over by Egypt. Many Palestinians became refugees in the 1948 war; they have still not been resettled and are the subject of the current debate on "right of return." 
  * 1956: Britain, France, & Israel invaded Egypt to force open the Suez Canal; they briefly occupied the Sinai Desert until pressured by the US and UN to withdraw. 
  * 1967: Israel won the "Six Day War" and occupied Gaza & Sinai (from Egypt); the West Bank (from Jordan); and the Golan Heights (from Syria). Jerusalem, split in 1948 between Israel & Palestine (and then Jordan), was unified under Israel; they annexed the whole city in 1980. 
  * 1973: A bloody war ended with no changed borders, but established the groundwork for an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979. Egypt's president, Anwar Sadat, shared with Israel's Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980 for his efforts, but paid for it with his life in an assassination in 1981. As part of the Egyptian peace treaty, Israel withdrew from Sinai (but not Gaza). The shaky peace has held up since, with regular US intervention and billions of dollars of annual US aid to both Egypt and Israel. 
  * 1982: Israel invaded Lebanon in response to terrorist attackes by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Israel surrounded the Lebanese capital, Beirut, forcing the PLO and its chairman, Yaserr Arafat, to withdraw. Israel began its withdrawl from Lebanon in 1985; Syria still occupies parts of the country. Israel also began establishing settlements on the West Bank in the late 1970s, which are a major point of contention in today's peace negotiations. 
  * 1987: Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank began an uprising against Israel, called "the Intifadeh." The PLO's Arafat signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, granting Palestine eventual self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank \-- this is the peace treaty which is still being phased in today. Jordan also signed a peace treaty with Israel, in 1994. 
  * 1996: Arafat is elected president of the "Palestinian Authority", and renounces the PLO Charter's clause calling for the destruction of Israel. In 1998, the Wye River Accords (under Pres. Clinton) negotiated further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. In 2000, a "Second Intifadeh" began in the West Bank; it continues today.

#### Persian Gulf

[![](../images/iraq_Map.gif)](../images/iraq_Map.gif)

  * The Iraq War formally ended on Dec. 15, 2011. Approximately 5,000 "security contractors" will remain to guard the US Embassy in Baghdad, plus several thousand more "general support contractors." Another 9,000 US troops are just over the border in Kuwait.   
  
IRAQ HISTORY:  
  

  * Throughout most of the 1980s, Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war. It ended with no border changes, and without any US intervention. 
  * In 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, claiming it as a province of Iraq. The US and numerous allied assembled by Pres. George H. W. Bush built up a counterforce in Saudi Arabia and succeeded in 1991 in pushing Saddam's army out of Kuwait. 
  * On the 10th anniversary of the Gulf War, President-elect George W Bush declared Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein "a big threat" and said he must be contained - by military force if necessary. 
  * In Jan 2001, outgoing President Clinton signed and transmitted to Congress a report on the provision of assistance to the Iraqi opposition. The report outlines plans for the transfer of humanitarian assistance for the relief of the Iraqi people and for radio and television broadcasting by the Iraqi National Congress (INC). The report also identifies certain issues that must be resolved in relation to implementation of those plans. 
  * The primary purpose of the provision is to assist those Iraqis who have been displaced from their homes or who are not receiving adequate assistance from the UN and other assistance organizations. 
  * Kuwaiti society is still deeply conservative. A strong Islamic current runs through the country-Islamists are fairly well represented in parliament and there is the odd Islamic extremist attack, against video stores or women not wearing the veil.
