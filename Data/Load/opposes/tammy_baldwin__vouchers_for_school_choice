Tammy Suzanne Green Baldwin (born February 11, 1962) is the junior United States Senator from Wisconsin and a member of the Democratic Party. She previously served as the U.S. Representative from Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district from 1999 to 2013, as well as serving three terms in the Wisconsin Assembly representing the 78th district.
Baldwin defeated her Republican opponent, former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson, in the 2012 U.S. Senate election. She is the first woman elected to represent Wisconsin in the Senate and the first openly gay U.S. Senator in history. As of 2012, Baldwin's voting record makes her one of the most liberal members of Congress.

Baldwin was born and grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, the daughter of Pamela (née Green) and Joseph Edward Baldwin. She was raised by her mother and her maternal grandparents. Her maternal grandfather, biochemist David E. Green, was Jewish (the son of immigrants from Russia and Germany), and her maternal grandmother, who was Anglican, was English-born. Baldwin's aunt is biochemist Rowena Green Matthews; through her maternal grandfather, Baldwin is a third cousin of comedian Andy Samberg.

==== Philosophy ====
In October 2012, Baldwin described herself as a proud progressive. Specifically, she said, "Fighting Bob La Follette stood up to fight the monopolies of the day and wanted people to have a stronger voice. We have the same powerful interests today who think they can write their own rules in Washington ... I consider myself a progressive and a fighter who's not afraid to stand up to those interests."
In 2003 Baldwin served on the advisory committee of the Progressive Majority, a political action committee dedicated to electing progressive candidates to public office.
Baldwin is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. According to a 2011 National Journal survey, Baldwin was among the most liberal members of the House. As of 2012, Baldwin's voting record made her one of the most liberal members of Congress.


==== Opposition to Iraq War ====
On October 10, 2002, Baldwin was among the 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq. She invoked "postwar challenges," saying that "there is no history of democratic government in Iraq", its "economy and infrastructure are in ruins after years of war and sanctions," and rebuilding would take "a great deal of money." In 2005, she joined the Out of Iraq Congressional Caucus.


==== Impeachment of Dick Cheney and Alberto Gonzales ====
On August 1, 2007, Baldwin cosponsored H. Res. 333, a bill proposing articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney, and H Res. 589, a bill proposing the impeachment of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. On January 20, 2008, Baldwin wrote in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that on Dec. 14, 2007, "I joined with my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee, Reps. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.) and Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), in urging Chairman Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) to conduct hearings on a resolution of impeachment now pending consideration in that committee." Although some constituents "say I have gone too far," others "argue I have not gone far enough" and feel "we are losing our democracy and that I should do more to hold the Bush administration accountable for its actions."


==== Health care reform ====
An outspoken advocate of single-payer, government-run health insurance since her days as a state legislator, Baldwin introduced the Health Security for All Americans Act, aimed at creating such a system, multiple times, beginning in 2000.
On July 26, 2004, Baldwin spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in prime time on the issue of health care. During the 110th Congress, Baldwin wrote several pieces of legislation that were passed by the House. The Reeve Paralysis Act authorizes additional funding for the treatment of ailments that result in immobility, while the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Act increases funding for low-income women to receive preventative screenings. Another bill she authored, the Veteran Vision Equity Act, guarantees benefits for military veterans.
Baldwin introduced provisions to the healthcare reform bill that specifically addressed disparities in health care for queer and trans* communities. Most significant among them were the “Early Treatment for HIV Act,” which sought to allow states to provide Medicaid coverage to low-income individuals living with HIV or AIDS; the Tax Equity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act, which sought to end the tax for gay employees whose partners are covered under their employment health insurance coverage; and a provision to collect data toward ending disparities in health care for queer and trans* people. None of these provisions were included in the final version of the PPACA, though there was some relief for HIV-positive individuals who have to purchase expensive AIDS-related medications. Baldwin did, however, author the amendment to the PPACA that allowed Americans to stay on their parents' plans until the age of 26, a significant part of the legislation.
In November 2009, Baldwin voted for the version of healthcare reform that included a public option, a government-run healthcare plan that would have competed with private insurers, but only the House passed that version. She ultimately voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, that become law in 2010.


==== Women's rights ====

Baldwin lent her support to such initiatives as the Equal Pay Act (EPA) and voted for the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. These acts criminalize and outline prosecution guidelines and punishments for wage discrimination based on sex. She received a grade of 100 from the League of Women Voters as of 2007. She has received favorable evaluations from other civil rights groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union.
Baldwin has advanced what she sees as stronger enforcement of laws against sexual violence and violence against women. She is a supporter of the Violence Against Women Act, which allowed victims of sexual violence and other sexual crimes to take their cases to federal courts and provided funding for various anti-sexual violence initiatives and programs. She is also among the sponsors of a resolution to promote and support National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.
Baldwin has promoted her efforts on behalf of women's health and reproductive rights. She sponsored the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, which helped low-income, underinsured, and uninsured women pay for cervical and breast cancer-related medical services.


==== Minority rights ====
Bahai groups praised her for supporting a bill that would make the desecration of Bahai cemeteries a violation of religious freedom.


==== Resolution on 9/11 victims ====
Baldwin was one of 22 members of Congress to vote against a 2006 resolution honoring victims of the September 11 attacks on the fifth anniversary of 9/11. (The resolution passed 395-22.) Baldwin says she voted against the resolution because it used divisive language amounting to an endorsement of the Patriot Act and immigration bills she characterized as overly harsh.
Her vote received renewed attention in the 2012 U.S. Senate campaign when Tommy Thompson's campaign released an ad about it. Thompson said in a statement, "Wisconsin voters need to know that Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin put her extreme views above honoring the men and women who were murdered by the terrorists in the Sept. 11 attacks on our nation." The Baldwin campaign responded by saying Thompson's ad was a "dishonest attack that tries to suggest Tammy Baldwin opposes honoring the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks."

=== 2012 election ===

Baldwin ran as the Democratic nominee against Republican nominee Tommy Thompson, who had formerly been governor and Secretary of Health and Human Services. She announced her candidacy on September 6, 2011, in a video emailed to supporters. She ran uncontested in the primary election, and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention about tax policy, campaign finance reform, and equality in the United States.
She was endorsed by Democracy for America, and she received campaign funding from EMILY's List, the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, and LPAC. Baldwin was endorsed by the editorial board of The Capital Times, who wrote that "Baldwin's fresh ideas on issues ranging from job creation to health care reform, along with her proven record of working across lines of partisanship and ideology, and her grace under pressure mark her as precisely the right choice to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl."
Former Gov. Tommy Thompson claimed that her “far left approach leaves this country in jeopardy.”
The candidates had three debates, on September 28, October 18, and October 26. According to Baldwin's Federal Election Commission filings, she raised about $12 million, over $5 million more than her opponent.
On November 6, 2012, Baldwin became the first openly gay candidate to be elected to the U.S. Senate. Because of her 14 years in the House of Representatives, under Senate rules she had the highest seniority in her entering class of senators.
The senator was featured in Time's November 19 edition in the Verbatim section, where she was quoted as saying "I didn't run to make history" on her historic election. In a separate section, she was also mentioned as a new face to watch in the Senate.


=== Tenure ===
On October 20, 2013, Baldwin was one of sixteen female Democratic senators to sign a letter endorsing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the 2016 Presidential Election.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Vouchers for school choice **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: The government should not be in the business of running schools. State-funded vouchers should pay for privately-run education at private schools, parochial schools, charter schools, home-schooling, or whatever schools parents choose. Bush's "No Child Left Behind" act sets the stage for terminating failing schools. 
  * **Support** means you believe: School choice helps the poor who would otherwise be stuck in failing schools. Why should only the elite be able to afford private school? Subsidize parents' school choices to foster equality, as long as the school respects separation of church and state, and meets basic state standards. Charter schools are a good compromise. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Continue experimenting with charter schools, and with public school choice, but only as a limited experiment, and no vouchers. We should create pressure to improve our public schools, not abandon them. Bush's "No Child Left Behind" act is an unfunded mandate. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Public schools are an important component of American society. Improve public schools rather than destroying them with vouchers. More teachers, smaller classes, more funding - then parents will _choose_ public schools. 

This question is looking for your views on how large a role the government
should play in running our school systems. However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Extend school choice to private as well as public schools 
  * Allow taxes to fund parochial schools 
  * Extend charter schools nationwide

* Support "No Child Left Behind" 

How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of limiting government's role in schooling. 
  * **Support** means you believe in school choice for **practical** reasons of improving education. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe more **practical** improvements could be made by focusing on public school improvement. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of public education. 
****BACKGROUND**

### School Choice

School Choice generally refers to a school district allowing parents to decide
which school within the district to send their kids to. The political issue is
whether to allow the choice to include private schools, parochial schools, and
home schooling at taxpayer expense. Taxpayer funding of parochial schools
potentially violates the Constitutional separation of church and state.
Taxpayer funding of private schools is controversial because it subsidizes
parents who are currently paying for private schools themselves, and are
usually more wealthy than the average public school family.

### Charter Schools

Charter schools are publicly-funded and publicly-controlled schools which are
privately run. They are usually required to adhere to fewer district rules
than regular public schools.

### Vouchers

Vouchers are a means of implementing school choice -- parents are given a
voucher by the school district, which entitles them to, say, $4,000 applicable
to either public school or private school tuition. The value of the voucher is
generally lower than the cost of one year of public education (which averages
$5,200), so private schools (where tuition averages $8,500) may require cash
payment in addition to the voucher.

### Education Buzzwords

Generally, any reference to standards, or especially to dealing with failing
schools, implies support of school vouchers. Generally, any reference to
smaller classrooms, or especially to building public schools, implies
opposition to funding private schools. Further decoding of education buzzwords
are detailed under [Education](../Background_Education.htm).  

### K-12 Education Statistics

  * **_Total spending is $260 billion**_, (7% federal; the rest split state & local) rising by 5% per year. 
  * **_Student population is 50 million**_, rising slowly (1 million per year) since 1984. 
  * **_Public school spending is $5,200 per student**_, staying about even with inflation. 
  * **_Parochial school costs $4,200 per student**_, not discounting church-provided buildings & other subsidies. 
  * **_Private school costs $8,500 per student**_, not discounting scholarships or other financial aid. 
  * **_90% attend public schools**_; about 6 million attend private & parochial schools. 
  * **_78% of schools have Internet access**_; 97% plan to by the year 2000. 
  * **_27% of classrooms have Internet access**_; lower in poor and minority schools. 
  * [College Statistics](../Background_Education.htm#Stats) are detailed on the Education page.
