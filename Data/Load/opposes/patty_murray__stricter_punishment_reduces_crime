Patricia Lynn "Patty" Murray (née Johns; October 11, 1950) is the senior United States Senator from Washington and a member of the Democratic Party. Murray was first elected to the Senate in 1992, becoming Washington's first female senator. Re-elected in 1998, 2004 and 2010, Murray has announced that she will seek a fifth term in 2016.
Murray has served as the Senate Majority Conference Secretary since 2007, making her the fourth-highest-ranking Democrat and the highest-ranking woman in the Senate. Murray chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2001 to 2003 and again from 2011 to 2013. Murray chaired the Senate Budget Committee from 2013 to 2015. She also previously served as co-chair of the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. Beginning in January 2015, Murray will be the Ranking Democratic Member on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. She is currently the 12th most senior member of the United States Senate.
On December 10, 2013, Murray and Republican Representative Paul Ryan announced that they had negotiated a two-year, bipartisan budget, known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.


== Early life ==
One of seven children, Murray was born in Bothell, Washington, to Beverly A. (née McLaughlin) and David L. Johns. Her mother was an accountant. Her father fought in World War II and was awarded a Purple Heart. Her ancestry includes Welsh, Irish, Scottish, and French-Canadian roots. When she was a teenager, her family was forced to apply for welfare assistance when her father became disabled due to the onset of multiple sclerosis. He had been the manager of a five-and-ten store. She attended Saint Brendan Catholic School as a young child.
Murray received her Bachelor of Arts degree in physical education from Washington State University in 1972. She was a preschool teacher for several years and taught a parenting class at Shoreline Community College from 1984–87.


== Early career ==
As a citizen-lobbyist for environmental and educational issues, she says she was once told by a state representative that she could not make a difference because she was just a "mom in tennis shoes". The phrase stuck, and she later used it in her successful campaigns for Shoreline School District Board of Directors (1985–1989), Washington State Senate (1989–1993), and United States Senate (1993–present). Murray was successful in gathering grassroots support to strike down proposed preschool program budget cuts.
Her 1988 State Senate campaign was successful and she unseated two-term incumbent Republican Bill Kiskaddon.

=== Legislation ===
On February 28, 2013, Murray introduced the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act into the United States Senate. The bill would prevent the United States Forest Service from removing a building from the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area in the State of Washington unless the agency determines that the structure is unsafe for visitors. Murray argued that the bill should be passed in order to help the tourism industry in the area, but protecting the lookout point in question. The bill would be "a very small step in what will be a very long recovery" and that it would "provide a glimmer of hope for the long-term recovery of this area." Murray was referring to the recovery of the area from the casualties and damage caused by the 2014 Oso mudslide. The bill passed in both the House and the Senate.


== Political positions ==


=== Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ===

In October 2002, Murray was one of 21 Democrats in the Senate to vote against the War Authoritization for invading Iraq. Quoted from her Senate speech:

Mr. President, if we do take action in Iraq, there is no doubt that our armed forces will prevail. We will win a war with Iraq decisively, and, God willing, we will win it quickly. But what happens after the war? That will have as big an impact on our future peace and security. Will we be obligated to rebuild Iraq? If so, how? Our economy is reeling, our budget is in deficit, and we have no estimate of the cost of rebuilding. And with whom? As New York Times columnist Tom Friedman points out, there's a retail store mentality that suggests to some – if "you break it, you buy it."

In December 2002, while speaking to students at Columbia River High School in Vancouver, Murray made a number of remarks about Osama bin Laden, as she attempted to explain why the US had such problems winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world, and how bin Laden had garnered support among some in the Middle East. Among other things, she had stated that bin Laden has "been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building daycare facilities, building health care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful. He's made their lives better. We have not done that." This attracted attention from political opponents, who argued that this constituted support for bin Laden. Republican state chairman Chris Vance was outraged, and said it was "despicable to imply that the American government should learn a lesson from the madman who murdered thousands of American citizens".


=== Global Trade Exchange ===
Senator Patty Murray put the controversial intelligence ports-data project Global Trade Exchange into the Homeland security budget.


=== Fiscal year 2014 federal budget ===
On December 10, 2013, Murray announced that she and Republican Representative Paul Ryan had reached a compromise agreement on a two-year, bipartisan budget bill, called the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The deal would cap the federal government's spending for Fiscal Year 2014 at $1.012 trillion and for Fiscal Year 2015 at $1.014 trillion. The proposed deal would eliminate some of the spending cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015. This does not decrease federal spending; instead, by reducing the amount of spending cuts the government was going to be forced to make by the sequester, it actually increases government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. The deal is supposed to make up for this increase in spending by raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers. The eliminated sequester cuts were spread evenly between defense spending and non-defense discretionary spending. The bill did not make any changes to entitlement programs.
The deal was scheduled to be voted on first in the House and then the Senate. Some people believed House Democrats would pass the deal as a way to reduce the sequester cuts. However, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) told a morning news show on December 12, 2013, that "members of his party are outraged that House Republicans are planning to adjourn without addressing unemployment benefits." Van Hollen said that "it is too early to say" whether a majority of House Democrats would vote in favor of the budget bill. The deal was also unpopular with many conservatives.


=== Health care ===
In 2014, Murray introduced legislation in the Senate called The Emergency Contraception Access and Education Act. Her bill received a number of cosponsors including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Barbara Boxer, Richard Blumenthal and Cory Booker. The bill would change the law to make hospitals that receive federal money to provide rape victims with emergency contraception. Murray has earned a reputation as an advocate for access to quality healthcare for women. In July 2014, she pushed an amendment to a bill in the Senate that would make sure that health insurance plans offer contraceptive coverage to patients regardless of employers' beliefs, religious or otherwise. Her amendment required 60 votes to move forward, and all but three Republican Senators voted against the measure.


=== Other ===
In May 2006, Murray, along with 38 of 44 Senate Democrats, voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611). The bill includes provisions to improve border security, increases fines and other punishments for employers of illegal immigrants, creation of a guest worker program (which includes an almost doubling of the number of H-1B visas), and creates a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country. The bill, with support from some in the GOP leadership, passed 62-36.
Murray repeatedly cosponsored legislation to create the Wild Sky Wilderness area in the Washington Cascade Range. She eventually succeeded, with the bill being signed by President Bush on May 8, 2008. Murray has also supported legislation to increase the size of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, also in the Washington Cascades.
On August 2, 2006, the New York Times said, "In 1994, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina was said to have engaged in excessive touching of his then-freshman colleague Patty Murray of Washington. Ms. Murray later asked for and received an apology from Mr. Thurmond, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported at the time. Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Murray declined to comment."


=== 2008 presidential election ===
On January 30, 2008, Murray endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. One month later, the Washington Democratic caucus awarded two-thirds of its delegates to Barack Obama and one-third to Clinton. After Clinton's June 7 concession, Murray switched her endorsement to Obama.


== Political campaigns ==


=== 1992 ===

In 1992, Murray announced her intention to run for the U.S. Senate following the publication of a series of articles by The Seattle Times alleging that incumbent Democratic Senator Brock Adams had sexually assaulted a number of women. Adams denied the allegations, but his popularity statewide was weakened considerably by the scandal and he chose to retire rather than risk losing the seat for his party. Murray defeated Representative Don Bonker to win the Democratic nomination. In the general election she faced Republican Representative Rod Chandler, whom she defeated 54% to 46% despite being outspent by a wide margin. Chandler seemed to have the upper hand in one of the debates until for some unknown reason he quoted the Roger Miller song "Dang Me." He was further damaged by the unpopularity of President George H. W. Bush in the Pacific Northwest.

=== 1998 ===

In 1998, Murray faced Representative Linda Smith, a staunch conservative and maverick who was one of nine House Republicans to vote against confirming House Speaker Newt Gingrich in early 1997, opposed gay rights and viewed homosexuality as a "morally unfit inclination." Murray won re-election by 58% to 42%.


==== Results ====


=== 2004 ===

In 2004, Murray faced another Republican Representative, George Nethercutt. Term limits became an issue in the campaign, as Democrats seized on Nethercutt's broken term-limits pledge that he had made when he unseated Speaker Tom Foley in 1994. Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a Senator from east of the Cascades since Miles Poindexter in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the war in Iraq. Nethercutt supported the invasion of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start and his campaign never gained much traction. In the general election, Murray was re-elected by 55% to 43%.


==== Results ====


=== 2010 ===

The 2010 election was the first Senate election to be held under the new blanket primary since Initiative 872 had passed in 2004. In the August 17 primary, Murray appeared on the ballot alongside four other Democratic candidates, six Republican candidates, a Reform Party candidate and three Independent candidates. Murray received a plurality, 46%, and advanced to the general election along with her main Republican challenger, former State Senator and two-time gubernatorial nominee Dino Rossi, who received 33%. Leading up to the election, Murray was endorsed by several prominent Washington State newspapers. Rossi conceded the election to Murray on November 4, 2010, two days after election day. The final tally showed Murray with 52.36% to Rossi's 47.64%, enabling Murray to go on to serve a fourth term in the United States Senate.

=== 2016 ===
Murray is seeking a fifth term in 2016. She faces no Democratic challengers in the August 2, 2016 primary election.

** Stricter punishment reduces crime **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: 'Three Strikes' laws put dangerous repeat offenders where they belong - behind bars, for life. And the Death Penalty gets rid of them once and for all. Mandatory sentencing and strict enforcement make sure that judges don't let off criminals too easily. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Keep death penalty and 'Three Strikes' laws on the books because they seem to be effective, but consider ways to deal with special circumstances so we can avoid horror stories of inappropriate imprisonment. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Strict enforcement of pre-determined sentencing threatens civil rights and should be used cautiously. Police, courts and prisons should focus on _effective_ enforcement rather than _strict_ enforcement. The death penalty should be used with extreme caution, if at all. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Judicial discretion should not be diminished by formulaic sentencing like 'Three Strikes.' Let judges and juries decide what penalties to apply in each case. The death penalty should be abolished as "cruel and unusual punishment". 

This question is looking for your views on whether stricter enforcement and
mandatory sentencing is the solution to crime.  However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Stricter penalties reduce all crimes 
  * 'Broken Windows' laws work 
  * Reduce judicial discretion 
  * Equivalent punishment for the taking of a life. 
  * Some people are bad and should be removed from society. 
  * The concept of rehabilitation is not applicable to prison. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of punishment as the purpose of incarceration. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** reasons like reducing judicial discretion. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe in **practical** reforms like sentencing guidelines, but not mandatory ones. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of rehabilitation as the purpose of incarceration.

****BACKGROUND**

**Black Lives Matter**

The 'Black Lives Matter' movement attempts to get police to stop treating
African-Americans differently than white suspects. The movement comes to the
fore whenever a video emerges from a police shooting of black suspects, as has
occurred regularly over the past years. Saying 'Black Lives Matter' blames the
police for institutionalized racism, and demands corrective action by changing
how police behave. The counter-movement uses the term 'Blue Lives Matter,'
implying support of police in a dangerous job.

The National Crime Victimization Survey found the lowest overall crime rate
since the survey began in 1973. Since 1994, violent crime rates have declined,
reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2010. Property crime rates continue
to decline as well.

![](Crime_Victim_Chart.gif)

Despite the falling crime rate, taking into account both violent crime and
property crime, 83 percent of Americans can expect to be a victim of crime at
least once in their lifetime. **Three Strikes Laws**

Three Strikes laws mean that people convicted of a third felony receive a
mandatory life sentence. The term refers to the baseball rule, "Three Strikes
and You're Out." Some candidates advocate Two Strikes or One Strike, which
generally means more mandatory sentencing, less judicial discretion, and less
chance of early parole. **Prison-Industrial Complex**

The opposite viewpoint from Three Strikes focuses on the increasing prison
population. In this view, along with prison privatization, imprisonment has
become big business, and hence subject to political pressure to increase
imprisonment. In particular, black males are ever more likely to be
imprisoned.

![](Crime_Prison_Industrial_Complex.jpg) **Broken Windows Laws**

Broken Windows laws mean that police focus on quality of life issues as much
as on crime itself. By addressing even minor crimes such as broken windows,
according to this theory, a community is less likely to tolerate any crime,
and overall crime rates should fall. **Community Policing**

Community Policing refers to a policy of crime prevention replacing incident
response. It is often accompanied by a broken windows policy, or by increased
police presence on the streets. **Tort Reform**

A tort means a civil infraction as opposed to a criminal violation. Tort
reform includes capping lawsuit rewards; banning frivolous lawsuits; or some
other change in civil lawsuit procedures. **Capital Punishment**

The death penalty is currently implemented in 34 states. It was re-legalized
by a Supreme Court decision in 1977. Since then, 1,278 people have been
executed. About 3,250 inmates remain on 'Death Row.' Texas is by far the
national leader in executions--it has executed 477 people as of Jan. 2012, 37%
of the national total. (Virginia is a very distant second with 109).

Much of the current controversy about the death penalty focuses on the
circumstances where it should be applied, and on its unequal application among
racial and socioeconomic classes. About 52% of death row inmates are Black or
other minority, versus 17% in the general population. Over 98% of death row
inmates are male.

**Hate Crimes**

Congress defines Hate Crimes as a crime in which the defendant intentionally
selects a victim because of the actual or perceived race, color, national
origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation of that person.
Hate Crimes are covered primarily as racial or anti-gay issues under [Civil
Rights](../Background_Civil_Rights.htm).  **Amendments V and VIII to the US
Constitution**

V. No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law.... (1791)  
VIII. Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. (1791)
