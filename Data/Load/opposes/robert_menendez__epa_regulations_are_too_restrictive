Robert "Bob" Menendez (born January 1, 1954) is the senior United States Senator from the State of New Jersey. He is a member of the Democratic Party of the United States. First appointed to the U.S. Senate in January 2006, he was later elected Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in January 2013.
In 1974, at the age of 20, he was first elected to the Union City School District's Board of Education and, in 1986, won the election for Mayor of Union City. In 1988, while continuing to serve as mayor, he was elected to represent the state's 33rd district in the General Assembly of New Jersey and, within three years, moved to the New Jersey State Senate, upon winning the March 1991 special election for the 33rd Senate district. By the next year of 1992, he won a seat in the Congress of the United States for the House of Representatives and represented New Jersey's 13th congressional district for six two-year terms, from 1993 to 2006. In January 2006, he was appointed to fill the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Jon Corzine, (being elected 54th Governor of New Jersey), and was elected to a full six-year term in November and re-elected following in 2012.
Menendez is one of three Latinos in the Senate; the others – also of Cuban ancestry – are both Republicans, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, of which both also announced in April 2015, that they were Republican Party candidates for the office of President of the United States in the 2016 Presidential Election.
In 2015, he was ranked #1 on The Hudson Reporter's annual Power List of the "Fifty Most Powerful Political Figures in Hudson County".
On April 1, 2015, Senator Menendez was indicted on federal corruption charges in the United States District Court, related to alleged favors he did for Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen and gifts he received from him, including campaign donations and private flights. Melgen was charged as well. Menendez has pleaded not guilty to all charges.


== Early life and education ==
Robert Menendez (later usually known as "Bob"), was born on January 1, 1954 in New York City, to Cuban immigrants who had left Cuba a few months earlier, in late 1953. His father, Mario Menéndez, was a carpenter, and his mother, Evangelina, a seamstress. The family subsequently moved to neighboring New Jersey where he grew up in a tenement in Union City. He attended Union Hill High School, where his speech teacher, Gail Harper, helped the introverted Menendez emerge as a powerful public speaker. Menendez explains, "My mother and Miss Harper made me understand the power of education, what it means to put a premium on learning and working hard." While at Union Hill, Menendez became the student body president. He went on to become the first in his family to go to college, attending Saint Peter's College in Jersey City, where he became a member of the Lambda Theta Phi fraternity. He graduated with a B.A. in political science, and subsequently earned his Juris Doctor degree from Newark's Rutgers School of Law in 1979.


=== Law practice ===
Menendez was admitted to the New Jersey Bar in 1980 and became a lawyer in private practice.


== Early political career (1986–1993) ==
In 1973, at age 19, while attending Saint Peter's College in Jersey City, he launched a successful petition drive against his mentor, then-Union City Mayor William Musto, to reform the local school board. He was elected to the Union City Board of Education in 1974, the youngest ever to do so. He did, nevertheless, stay close to Musto throughout the 1970s and supported him in Musto's re-election to the New Jersey Senate in 1978.
Menendez was elected mayor of Union City, the state's 13th most populous locality, in 1986 after an unsuccessful run against the popular Musto in 1982. Menendez served as mayor until 1992 and, following election, in November 1987, to represent the state's 33rd district in General Assembly, continued to fulfill both elective offices until March 1991, when he moved from the General Assembly's 33rd district to the New Jersey Senate's 33rd district, upon winning the special election called following the death of State Senator Christopher Jackman.


== U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2006) ==


=== Elections ===
In 1992, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Frank Guarini, of New Jersey's 14th congressional district, decided to retire after redistricting. The district had been renumbered as the 13th district, and reconfigured as a Latino-majority district. Menendez decided to run in the primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—and defeated Robert Haney Jr. in the Democratic primary 68%–32%. He won the general election with 64% of the vote, defeating New Jersey Superior Court Judge Fred J. Theemling, Jr. in the general election. After that, he won re-election every two years with at least 71% of the vote until he was appointed to the U.S. Senate in January 2006.


=== Tenure ===
Menendez, who is described as very close to Republicans on foreign policy voted for the failed Kosovo Resolution, authorizing the use of military force against Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War. He was an early advocate of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities, sponsoring the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1998, which passed the House, but failed to pass in the Senate.
Menendez voted in favor of Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, authorizing the President the use of military force in Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks. In 2002, Menendez voted against the Iraq Resolution to authorize the invasion of Iraq.
Menendez voted against the United Nations Reform Act of 2005, cutting U.S. funding to the United Nations by 50% over 3 years, and was a sponsor of the Tsunami Orphans and Unaccompanied Children Act of 2005 to provide assistance to victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.
In 2001, Menendez voted in favor of the PATRIOT Act, and for its reauthorization in 2006.
In the 105th Congress, Menendez voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, repealing provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, repealing provisions that limited Investment banks from acquiring Insurance companies or other Commercial banks, and voted in favor of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. After the 2001 Enron scandal, Menendez voted with 333 other members of the House in favor of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act.
Although he had sometimes been portrayed as the political boss of Hudson County, he strongly dislikes this appellation, particularly because, according to an anonymous close source quoted in the December 11, 2005 Union City Reporter, "there is no boss of Hudson County". In 2005 a New York Times Op-Ed characterized Menendez by stating, "Since entering politics as a corruption-fighting mayor of Union City, N.J., Mr. Menendez has become a proponent of business as usual. He has long been an entrenched de facto leader of the Hudson County Democratic machine."
On August 27, 2006, two Republican state lawmakers filed an ethics complaint against Menendez, alleging he broke conflict-of-interest rules when he rented property out to a nonprofit agency that receives federal funds. Menendez helped the organization win designation as a Federally Qualified Health Center in 1998. That designation allowed the agency to receive additional federal grants. Menendez allies noted that the organization in question, the North Hudson Community Action Corp., which provides social services and health care to the poor and was founded in 1960, had received federal funding for years before Menendez was in Congress, and receives its funding based on mathematical formulas. Menendez maintains that he rented the property out below market-value because "he was supportive of its work". The total rent collected over nine years was over $300,000.
In September 2006, just a few weeks before the 2006 senate elections, the office of the US District Attorney, Republican Chris Christie, began investigating the rental deal with NHCAC, subpoenaing records from them. Some Democrats criticized the investigation, particularly the timing of the investigation and news leaks, as being politically motivated.
On August 18, 2015, Menendez announced his opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran, saying "President Obama continues to erroneously say that this agreement permanently stops Iran from having a nuclear bomb, Let’s be clear: What the agreement does is to recommit Iran not to pursue a nuclear bomb, a promise they have already violated in the past." 


== U.S. Senate (2006–present) ==
In January 2006, Menendez was appointed by Governor Jon Corzine to fill the remaining year in the Senate seat from which Corzine resigned upon being elected the previous month as Governor of New Jersey. While several other names had been mentioned, Menendez was the early favorite among pundits for Governor-elect Corzine's replacement to fill the vacancy that would be created when Corzine resigned from the Senate. Corzine's decision to appoint Menendez got the support of several Latino groups, including the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Menendez was the sixth Latino to serve in the United States Senate.


=== Elections ===


==== 1996 ====

When incumbent Democrat U.S. Senator Bill Bradley decided to retire in August 1995, Menendez made known his intention to run in the November 1996 election for the seat, but eventually dropped out of the race and endorsed Robert Torricelli, the Democrat representing New Jersey's 9th congressional district. Similarly, in 1999, when the state's other U.S. Senator, Democrat Frank Lautenberg, also announced his planned retirement, Menendez again decided not to run, with the Democratic nomination for the November 2000 race ultimately going to Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine who won the general election.


==== 2006 ====

In the midterm elections held November 7, 2006, near the end of his one-year appointment, Menendez ran to retain his seat in the Senate. He defeated Republican Thomas Kean, Jr., incumbent minority whip in the New Jersey Senate and son of former state governor Thomas Kean, with 53% of the vote to Kean's 45%.
Menendez was endorsed by several newspapers including The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Star-Ledger, and The Record.


==== 2012 ====

Menendez ran for re-election for a full second term and defeated Republican Joe Kyrillos on November 6, 2012.

==== Immigration issues ====
Senator Menendez is an "aggressive advocate" of immigration reform, calling it the "civil rights issue of our time". Menendez had introduced multiple pieces of legislation in attempts to overhaul what Menendez calls our "failed immigration system." Menendez introduced the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2011. It was seen as a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. Immigration System; the 697-page bill died in the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 2009 he introduced the Orphans, Widows, and Widowers Protection Act, granting a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented widowers and orphans of deceased U.S. Citizens.
Menendez is a strong supporter of the DREAM Act, saying that, "Children should not be punished for the actions of their parents. These kids have grown up as Americans, worked hard in school and now they want to serve our country in the military or pursue a college education. This is the only home many of them have known and they should be encouraged to pursue the American dream." He voted for the DREAM Act in 2007 and was a cosponsor along with 31 other members of the Senate in the Act's failed passage in 2010.
Menendez voted against denying legal status to undocumented citizens convicted of domestic violence, crimes against children and crimes relating to the illegal purchase or sale of firearms, but voted in favor of establishing a six-month to twenty-year ban for undocumented immigrants seeking citizenship who had been convicted for the same crimes along with of obstruction of justice, human trafficking and the participation of criminal gang activity.
Menendez has been a supporter of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, and Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, voting for both bills. Menendez voted against Senate Amendment 1151, declaring English as the national language of the Federal government of the United States.
He voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers and expanding surveillance at the Mexico-United States border, and was a supporter of Senate Amendment 4775, a provision Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2007 which would have appropriated $1.8 billion for the construction of 370 miles (600 km) of triple-layered fencing, and 461 miles (742 km) of vehicle barriers along parts of the Southwest.
On January 28, 2013, Menendez was a member of a bi-partisan group of eight Senators which announced principles for comprehensive immigration reform (CIR). Menendez was recognized in 2014 by the National Council of La Raza (America's largest Latino advocacy organization) for his work in supporting immigration reform as a member of the "Gang of Eight."


==== Environmental issues ====
Menendez had introduced legislation that would give incentives for the conversion of vehicles to run on natural gas; the bill did not make it out of committee in its first incarnation, and failed to receive 60 votes required to pass in 2012.


==== Education issues ====
Menendez has also sponsored the Student Non-Discrimination Act, expanding Title IX of the Education Amendments Act to LGBT students, and the Safe Schools Improvement Act of 2011 which would also amend the Higher Education Act of 1965. Menendez voted for the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009 saying that; "When someone is harassed, assaulted or killed simply because of the type of person they are, it’s a crime against an entire community and our nation’s values."  In 2012 Menendez received a 94% rating from the Human Rights Campaign.
During a press conference about the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, Menendez claimed that New Jersey was facing a $10.5 billion shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget that would lead to cuts in state spending on education. This statement was rated as "false" by Politifact because the 2012 budget was in fact balanced and increased funding for education.


==== Gay Marriage issues ====
Menendez voted for the Defense of Marriage Act as a congressman in 1996; on December 18, 2011, he came out in support, and is a cosponsor, of the Respect for Marriage Act, repealing DOMA. Menendez also voted for the U.S. Military's Don't ask, don't tell as a congressman, and was a cosponsor DADT repeal act in 2010.
On the issue of gay rights Menendez said "Two people who want to be committed to each other should be able to enter into marriage, and they should receive the benefits that flow from that commitment."


==== Foreign affairs issues ====
In February 2006, Menendez cosponsored legislation with New York Senator Hillary Clinton to make it illegal for foreign governments to buy U.S. port operations. The legislation was a direct response to Dubai Ports World's efforts to purchase Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O) of the United Kingdom, which operates six major U.S. ports. Menendez said, "Our ports are the front lines of the war on terrorism. They are both vulnerable targets for attack and venues for smuggling and human trafficking. We wouldn't turn the Border Patrol or the Customs Service over to a foreign government, and we can't afford to turn our ports over to one either."
On April 25, 2008, a former undercover F.B.I. agent revealed in the book Ruse: Undercover with FBI Counterintelligence that Cuban diplomats approached freelance blogger and journalist Robert Eringer to investigate Menendez. It was suggested that the Cuban government was determined to generate derogatory information about the senator, along with Florida Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, because of their anti-Castro lobbying efforts.
In October 2009, Menendez sent a strongly worded letter of protest to Cyprus President Dimitris Christofias, castigating him for his praise of Cuba's totalitarian system. Christofias, the leader of AKEL, Cyprus's Communist Party, from 1988 to 2009 and president from 2008 to 2013, had paid a state visit to Cuba in September 2009 for the opening of Cyprus's new embassy and, in his speech, made a number of anti-American embargo references, and spoke of the "common struggle of Cyprus and Cuba". In his letter to Christofias, Menendez stated "you cannot claim human rights violations by Turkey in your country and then ignore such violations in Cuba. Second, you cannot call for property rights for Greek Cypriots and then deny them on Cuba. Finally, you cannot take issue with the militarization of northern Cyprus and then ignore the state security apparatus that oppresses the Cuban people."


===== Senate foreign relations committee =====
Menendez became chairman of the prestigious Foreign Relations committee following John Kerry's confirmation as Secretary of State in January 2013. His "Syria force resolution" was praised by President Obama and others. In the 114th United States Congress, as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez continues to be a leader on issues regarding Iran, supporting legislation that would take a "hard line" on that nation. Following his being indicted, Menendez stepped down as ranking member.


====== Foreign affairs legislation sponsored ======
Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (S. 793; 113th Congress) – Menendez introduced this bill on April 24, 2013. The bill would require the Secretary of State to develop a multiyear strategy to bolster the Organization of American States (OAS) and improve the OAS’s processes for managing its budget and personnel. The act would require the Secretary to provide quarterly briefings to the Congress on the progress of implementing that strategy.
Support for United States-Republic of Korea Civil Nuclear Cooperation Act – Menendez introduced this bill that would authorize the President to extend the term of the "Agreement for Cooperation between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Korea Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy" to a date no later than March 19, 2016. The bill passed the Senate on January 27, 2014 and the House on January 28, 2014.
Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 was introduced to the 113th Congress on September 16, 2014 to address pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. The bill was signed into law by U.S. President Barack Obama on December 18, 2014.


==== Other issues ====
On September 28, 2006 Menendez voted for the Military Commissions Act.
On June 12, 2007, Menendez endorsed Hillary Clinton's presidential bid and was given the position of National Campaign Co-Chair. Subsequently he made numerous media appearances voicing his support for her campaign.
In 2009, Menendez succeeded Senator Chuck Schumer of New York as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Menendez's tenure, which has followed two straight election cycles of dramatic Democratic gains, has been marked by more troubled Democratic outlook. Critics of Menendez have pointed out the surprising Democratic loss in the 2010 Massachusetts Senate special election that followed the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy; Menendez's lower-key, more cautious management style; and Democratic problems caused by retirements in Indiana and elsewhere. Others, such as Schumer, have defended Menendez's performance, citing the negative political climate.
An effort to recall Senator Menendez was launched in early 2010 by a group of New Jersey citizens. Although Article 1, Paragraph 2(b) of the New Jersey Constitution expressly authorizes such a recall, state officials fought the effort in court. On March 16, 2010, a State Appeals court ruled that the recall petition could go forward. Menendez said he was surprised that a group claiming to be true to the Constitution is trying now, in his words, "to undermine it". Menendez appealed the ruling. Legal experts have debated the constitutionality of a state recall of a federal officeholder. On November 18, 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court found that the New Jersey provision violated the U.S. Constitution.
In 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported that Menendez had written to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, asking him to approve an acquisition that would rescue from the prospect of receivership a New Jersey bank, First Bank Americano, operated by Menendez contributors. It was discovered that "eight of 15 directors, including the bank’s chairman and vice-chairman, have been contributors to Menendez or his political action committee." Former federal bank regulator William K. Black called the letter "grotesquely inappropriate" and said that "the letter crossed an unofficial line by asking regulators to approve an application instead of simply asking that it be given consideration." An aide to the senator said that his decision to write the letter was not influenced by political contributions. A highly critical report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that the institution had engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices, including operating without adequate supervision by its board of directors, an excessive level of delinquent or bad loans, inadequate earnings and insufficient coverage of its assets.
On January 5, 2012 Menendez blocked Judge Patty Shwartz, an Obama administration nominee to a federal judgeship, drawing speculation that the block was placed because of Shwartz's relationship with the head of the public corruption unit for New Jersey’s federal prosecutor who had investigated the senator during his 2006 election fight. Menendez denied personal motivation for the block. He has long contended that the corruption investigation was politically motivated. The investigation was closed in late 2011, with no charges filed.


=== Federal Investigations of Menendez ===
In November 2012, the conservative political news and opinion website Daily Caller published allegations that Menendez had contact with underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. The allegations were promoted by Republican Party operatives, who arranged interviews for two women accusing Menendez of patronizing prostitutes with ABC News and the Daily Caller. However, ABC News News and other news organizations such as the New York Times, and the New York Post declined to publish the allegations, viewing them as unsubstantiated and lacking credibility. One of the women who had accused Menendez stated that she had been paid to falsely implicate the Senator and had never met him. The Daily Caller says this woman was not interviewed for their story. Menendez's office described the allegations as "manufactured" by a "right-wing blog" as a politically motivated smear. On March 18, 2013 police in the Dominican Republic announced that three women had said they had been paid $300–425 each to lie about having had sex with Menendez.
On December 12, 2012 it was reported that the Senator's office had an unpaid intern volunteering who had let his visitor visa expire and who was a registered sex offender. The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been aware of the man as early as October 2012 but according to the Associated Press, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) instructed their Federal agents not to arrest the man until after Election Day. Menendez denied knowing about the allegation of the directive to delay the arrest and only recently learned of the arrest. According to two federal officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case, the intern was arrested in front of his home in New Jersey on December 6, 2012.
It was reported on March 14, 2013, that a federal grand jury in Miami was investigating Menendez regarding his role in advocating for the business interests of ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, one of his major donors. Menendez's efforts to push U.S. government officials to enforce a lucrative port security contract would have benefitted Melgen, as well as Pedro Pablo Permuy, a former national security adviser and senior legislative aide to Mr. Menendez. In 2012, Melgen's business had donated over $700,000 to Majority PAC, a political action committee supporting Democratic candidates; the PAC spent more than $582,000 on Menendez's behalf.


=== 2015 federal indictment on corruption charges ===
On March 6, 2015, it was announced that the United States Department of Justice was preparing criminal corruption charges against Menendez in the United States District Court. On April 1, 2015, Menendez was indicted on corruption charges, accused of using his office to improperly benefit Salomon Melgen, a personal friend and an eye doctor in Florida and political donor, who offered the Senator an array of perks including trips on his private jet, three nights at a five-star Paris hotel, a round of golf at a private club in West Palm Beach and access to an exclusive Dominican resort - some of which Menendez didn't disclose on financial disclosure forms. Menendez also helped acquire visas for several of Melgen's girlfriends. The indictment charged Menendez with 14 counts, including bribery, conspiracy, and making false statements. Melgen was also charged in the case. Menendez voluntarily stepped down as ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee after his indictment.
According to the Justice Department's indictment Menendez asked top State Department officials to pressure the Dominican Republic’s government into enforcing a port-security contract that would benefit Melgen’s company while at the same time Melgen was promising to give $60,000 to Menendez’s political campaign. The U.S. Government claims that Menendez, on or about May 16, 2012, met an assistant secretary at the State Department to discuss the security screening contract and on that day Melgen's family donated $40,000 to the New Jersey Democratic State "Victory" campaign and $20,000 to Menendez’s legal defense fund.
A report on the cable/satellite media channel Fox News Channel alleged that the indictment may be connected to his position on Iran, something which a report on The Washington Post called a conspiracy theory.
Joe Scarborough of MSNBC had a different take, saying

What Bob Menendez did pales in comparison to this book.[referring to Clinton Cash] The Clintons have made $150 million over the past decade because of contacts they made during public service. I will sit back and let you ask the tough questions. I’m just curious, though, why aren’t the Clintons held to a standard that Bob McDonnell’s not held to. That Bob Menendez is not held to. That all of these congressmen that get thrown into jail for going on a — going to a Redskins game or going on a golf trip, compared to $150 million.


== Awards and honors ==
In December 2013 the town of West New York, New Jersey (which borders his childhood home of Union City to the north) honored Menendez by renaming its Public School No. 3 after him (unusual as he was still living). The renaming of the elementary school was celebrated with a December 4, 2013 ceremony at that school at which city, county, state and federal dignitaries were present and spoke in various addresses of support and compliments.


== Personal life ==
In 1976, Menendez married Jane Jacobsen, a teacher for the Union City Board of Education and Union City Public Schools. They had two children: a daughter Alicia (who is now a television commentator), and son Robert. They divorced in 2005.
Menendez currently lives in Paramus, New Jersey.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** EPA regulations are too restrictive **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: The earth is humankind's domain to do with as we see fit. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Human needs come first, but it's ok to account for environmental needs after human needs are accounted for. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: We should balance animal rights with human needs, accounting for nature's value for humans as well as for other environmental benefits. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Animals have inherent rights, and nature has inherent value. 

This question is looking for your views on environmentalism both under
economic terms and " under the 5th Amendment.  However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * No 'rights' to clean air and water 
  * "Sustainability" is a codeword for "Socialism" 
  * In Gen.1:26, God promised Man dominion over the earth and all its resources. 
  * The "takings clause" of the Constitution prohibits eminent domain for most reasons. 
  * You cannot sue a company for polluting 
  * Wise Use 
  * Human needs over animal rights 
  * There's plenty of room for animals; right next to the mashed potatoes on my plate. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you oppose the **principle** of environmentalism, and you believe in the **principle** of placing human needs first. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** methods of natural resource use. You prioritize people first, but goals can be accomplished with respect for nature. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe **practical** compromise between economic needs and environmental needs. You might cite that Gen.1:26 properly uses the term "stewardship," implying caretaker status, rather than "dominion," implying ownership status. You cite "sustainability" as the rationale for environmental action; and recognize that hunters and anglers are your potential allies. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of animal rights and the **principle** of the value of nature for its own sake. You support vegetarianism; take pride in the title of "tree-hugger"; and abhor hunting. You cite morality (rather than sustainability) as the rationale for environmental action. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

**Environment and Energy**   
Energy issues have so dominated the 2012 election that all other environmental
issues have fallen aside. In fact, the term "environmental issues" in this
election cycle has come to mean "energy issues." In this section, we stick to
non-energy environmental issues -- see our [Energy & Oil](Energy_+_Oil.htm)
section for the energy-based issues. Some hot topics in the 2012 election
cycle:

  * **_Yucca Mountain:**_ A federally-owned mountain in Nevada which the federal government has proposed as a long-term repository for nuclear waste. Yucca Mountain was selected because, in theory, it is geologically stable enough to survive intact for the tens of thousands of years until the nuclear waste becomes harmless. The site was first proposed under President Reagan in 1985-1987; Congress approved it under President Bush in 2002; and then Congress canceled the program under President Obama in April 2011. 

  * **_Big Dig:**_ The "Big Dig" refers to Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project, conducted in large part while Mitt ROmney was governor of Massachusetts. The Big Dig converted an elevated highway, I-93, into a 3.5 mile tunnel through central Boston, and added a third tunnel under Boston Harbor to Logan Airport. The original cost of the project in 1998 was proposed at $3 billion; it grew into a $22 billion project by the latest 2012 estimate. In addition to several construction deaths, a motorist was killed when a section of ceiling collapsed in 2006, attributed to inappropriate glue to hold up the concrete ceiling. The project was also plagued by water leaks for several years, attributed to failure to meet contract specifications. 

  * **_Conservation Easements:**_ Refers to land deeds which restrict future usage of the parcel of land to protect habitat, ban hunting or logging, or otherwise meet conservation goals. Also known as "Land Trusts," they have been tremendously successful in preserving open space and wildlife habitat. To assure that open space and habitat will be there for future generations, Congress provided targeted income tax relief to small farmers and ranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified conservation easement. 

  * **_Green Jobs:**_ "Green Jobs" refers to subsidizing environmentally-friendly industries, usually alternative energy. 

Every recent president, including Obama, has promised "green jobs" in their
State of the Union speeches; but the only action so far has been to mention it
again in the subsequent year's State of the Union message.

"Solyndra" has become shorthand for "cronyism in the name of green jobs."
Solyndra declared bankruptcy in Sept. 2011 after receiving a $527 million
federal loan to support commercial-scale manufacturing for its solar
photovoltaic panels. Romney visited the abandoned Solyndra factory in May 2012
to criticize Obama's policy.  
**Endangered Species**
  * **_Endangered Species Act (ESA):**_ 1973 law prohibiting activities that harm endangered plants or animals or their habitats. Which species are threatened & endangered are listed or delisted by the Secretaries of Interior & Commerce. The controversy comes from limitations on private property to protect one species. 

  * **_Takings:**_ The federal government is allowed to take private property when it serves the public interest (via eminent domain) but must pay fair market value. When the ESA regulates private property use (such as disallowing development), the value is decreased even though the property is not fully taken. The takings controversy concerns how much the government should pay to property owners when their property is only partially taken. 
**Pollution Control vs. Cost Control**
  * **_The Clean Air Act:**_ (CAA) regulates industrial smokestacks and other sources of smog, acid rain, and other air pollutants. The CAA uses numerous market incentives, including pollution permits that are traded on open markets, to minimize costs. 

  * **_The Clean Water Act:**_ (CWA) regulates point-source (sewage pipes) and non-point-source (land and road runoff) water pollution. The EPAs approach since the early 1990s is watershed-based, which means cooperating across political boundaries. 

  * **_CAFE standard:**_ The Corporate Average Fuel Economy requires that all automobile manufacturers maintain an average of 28 miles per gallon (mpg) for all vehicles sold. 

  * **_Command-and-control:**_ Standardized regulations with central enforcement (usually by EPA), as opposed to market-based incentives. 
**Federal Lands**   
The federal government owns 27% of all US land (more than the combined area of
Alaska, Texas, & California).

  1. **_BLM:**_ The Bureau of Land Management owns 270 million acres of cattle grazing land. 
  2. **_USFS:**_ The US Forest Service owns 185 million acres of timber land. 
  3. **_FWS:**_ The Fish & Wildlife Service owns 90 million acres of waterways and surrounding lands. 
  4. **_NPS:**_ The National Park Service owns 75 million acres of national parks and national rivers. 
  5. **_States:**_ State and local governments own 200 million acres of land (another 9% of total US land area). 
**Land Use Buzzwords**
  * **_Devolution:**_ Some candidates believe that land use decisions should devolve from the federal government to state or local government, to encourage community involvement. 
  * **_Wise Use:**_ A code word which means stop federal land use restrictions. It comes from the Forest Services founding doctrines, which say that wise land use includes commercial use plus recreational use. 
  * **_Land Trusts:**_ Privately-held land which has restrictions on development (e.g., wildlife sanctuaries). 
  * **_Suburban Sprawl:**_ Uncontrolled development that fosters automobile usage rather than mass transit. 
  * **_Urban Redevelopment:**_ Restoring inner-city blighted communities via empowerment zones, etc. 
  * **_Brownfields:**_ Locating industrial development on former waste sites (versus wide-open greenfields). 
  * **_Superfund:**_ EPA cleanup of toxic waste sites. 

> **Amendment V to the US Constitution**  
> ...nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation.(1791)
