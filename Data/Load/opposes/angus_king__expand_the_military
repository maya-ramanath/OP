Angus Stanley King, Jr. (born March 31, 1944) is an American politician and the junior United States Senator from the state of Maine. As a former Democrat and political independent, he served as the 72nd Governor of Maine from 1995 to 2003, winning his first election in a 3-way race with 35.37% of the vote.
King won Maine's 2012 Senate election to replace the retiring Republican Olympia Snowe and took office on January 3, 2013. For committee assignment purposes, he caucuses with the Democratic Party.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
King was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the son of Ellen Archer (née Ticer) and Angus Stanley King, Sr., a lawyer. He has spent most of his adult years in the state of Maine. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1966 and the University of Virginia School of Law in 1969. While a student at Dartmouth, King joined the Delta Upsilon social fraternity.
Soon after graduation from Virginia, King entered private law practice in Brunswick, Maine. He was a staff attorney for Pine Tree Legal Assistance in Skowhegan. In 1972, he served as chief counsel to U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Narcotics. King served as a legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator William Hathaway in the 1970s. He was also well-known statewide as a television host on public television. In 1973, when he was 29, King was diagnosed with an aggressive form of malignant melanoma during a routine doctor's appointment—an appointment, King says, he never would have made had he not had health insurance at the time. As a result of the visit and the early detection, King was able to receive treatment, and the experience undergirds his support for the Affordable Care Act.
In 1975, King returned to Maine to practice with Smith, Loyd and King in Brunswick. In 1983, he was appointed vice president of Swift River/Hafslund Company, which developed alternative energy (hydro and biomass) projects in New England. In 1989, King founded Northeast Energy Management, Inc. The company developed, installed, and operated large-scale electrical energy conservation projects at commercial and industrial facilities throughout south-central Maine.


== Governor of Maine ==


=== 1994 election ===

In May 1993, King announced he would run for governor of Maine as an independent, as incumbent Governor John McKernan, a Republican, was term-limited and could not seek another term. King abandoned his lifelong affiliation with the Maine Democratic Party. "The Democratic Party as an institution has become too much the party that is looking for something from government," King explained to the Bangor Daily News a few weeks after he announced he would be running.
The Republican nominee was Susan Collins, Commissioner of Professional and Financial Regulation under Governor John McKernan and a protégée of U.S. Senator William Cohen, and at the time was relatively unknown to the electorate. The Democratic nominee was former Governor and U.S. Representative Joseph E. Brennan. It was Brennan's fifth campaign for governor.
The general election was a highly competitive four-way race between King, Collins, Brennan, and Green Party nominee Jonathan Carter. King decided to invest early in television advertising during Maine's unusually early June primary, allowing him to emerge from the primary season on an equal footing with his rivals. King positioned himself as a businessman and a pragmatic environmentalist focused on job creation and education. The Washington Times described him as an idealist who "wants to slash regulations but preserve the environment; hold the line on taxes; impose work and education requirements on welfare recipients; experiment with public school choice and cut at least $60 million from the state budget." His opponents criticized him for flip-flopping. Collins argued King "presents different images, depending on who he is talking to. Angus has been a Democrat his whole life. In my opinion, he became an independent because he didn't think he could beat Joe Brennan in a primary. He's extremely smooth, articulate and bright, but he says different things to different groups."
King narrowly won the November 8 election with 35% of the vote to Brennan's 34%, a margin of just 7,878 votes. (Collins received 23% of the vote and Carter 6%.) King won eight counties, Collins five and Brennan three. King's election as an independent was not unprecedented in Maine politics, as independent James B. Longley had been elected twenty years earlier.


=== 1998 election ===

Governor King won reelection to a second term in 1998 with 59% of the vote. He defeated Republican Jim Longley Jr. (the son of the former governor) (19%) and Democrat Thomas Connolly (12%). King's 59% was the highest a candidate had received since Brennan's 1982 reelection with 62% of the vote. Brennan's 1982 victory was also the last time before 1998 that a gubernatorial candidate had won a majority of the vote, and King's 1998 reelection remains the last time in a Maine gubernatorial election that the winner got a majority.


=== Tenure ===
During his tenure, King was the only governor in the United States unaffiliated with any political party. He was also one of only two governors nationwide not affiliated with either of the two major parties, the other being Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who was elected in 1998 as a member of the Reform Party. The term of Connecticut's independent governor Lowell Weicker ended when King's began. In his book Independent Nation (2004), political analyst John Avlon describes all three governors as radical centrist thinkers.

While in office King launched the Maine Learning Technology Initiative (MLTI) to provide laptops for every public middle-school student in the state, the first initiative of its kind in the nation. It met with considerable resistance due to its cost but was enacted by the Maine Legislature. On September 5, 2002, the state began the program with a four-year $37.2-million contract with Apple Inc. to equip all seventh- and eighth-grade students and teachers in the state with laptops. "I think we're going to demonstrate the power of one-to-one computer access that's going to transform education", King said in a Wired magazine interview. "The economic future will belong to the technologically adept." While ushering in the program, King quipped, "We've still got fish but we're heavily into the chips", in reference to Maine's fishing industry and the new laptop initiative.
One of King's more controversial initiatives was a law requiring all school employees – including volunteers and contractors working in schools – to be fingerprinted by the Maine State Police, and to have background checks conducted on them. The program purported to protect children from abuse by potential predators working within the schools but met with strong resistance from teachers' unions, which considered it a breach of civil liberties. The law's supporters claimed the fingerprinting requirement would stop previous offenders from coming to Maine to work in the schools and that if Maine did not have this requirement it would send a message to previous offenders that they could work in Maine without fear of being identified as child abusers. The law's critics maintained that there was no evidence of a problem with child abuse by school employees and the fingerprinting represented a violation of constitutional guarantees (a claim not supported by Supreme Court rulings on the issue). Fifty-seven teachers from across the state resigned in protest of the bill. The Maine Legislature voted to exempt current school employees, but King vetoed that in April 1997. The cost of the requirement was initially to be paid for by the school employees themselves but the Legislature voted to have the state fund it.


== Post-gubernatorial career (2003–12) ==
The day after he left office in 2003, King, his wife, Mary Herman, and their two children – Ben, 14, and Molly, 10 – embarked on a road trip in a 40-foot motor home to see America. Over the next six months, the family traveled 15,000 miles and visited 33 states before returning home in June 2003.
From 2004, King was a lecturer at Bowdoin College teaching a course called "Leaders and Leadership"; in the fall of 2009 and 2010, he taught a similar course at Bates College. He joined one of Maine's premier law firms, Bernstein Shur, and a mergers and acquisitions advisory firm (Leaders LLC) in Portland, Maine. He also worked on issues of sustainable and renewable energy. In spring 2009, he endorsed the Maine Green Energy Project, a summer program for young people to learn to build and advocate for green energy in Maine.
King was also involved in a wind power utility company, Independence Wind, co-founded with Robert Gardiner. In August 2009, Independence Wind along with joint venture partner Wagner Forest Management won Maine DEP approval for construction of a proposed $120-million, 22-turbine, utility-scale wind power project along a prominent mountain ridge in Roxbury, Maine. To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, King sold his part of the company after entering the 2012 U.S. Senate election. Of the project, King has said, "People who say wind is only an intermittent resource are looking for a one-shot solution. And my experience is that there are rarely silver bullets, but there is often silver buckshot. Wind is an adjunct source of energy. Ten percent, 20% can be very significant..." He also helped launch the Vital Signs education website at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in 2009. Vital Signs builds upon the 1-to-1 laptop network King established as governor.


== United States Senate ==


=== Elections ===

On March 5, 2012, King announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Olympia Snowe. King said "hogwash" to allegations by some Republicans that he had cut a deal with Democrats to keep U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree out of the race.
King's Senate campaign came under scrutiny for posting a heavily edited newspaper profile of him to the campaign website.
On November 6, 2012, King won the Senate race with 53% of the vote, beating Democrat Cynthia Dill and Republican Charlie Summers. The following week, King announced that he would caucus with Senate Democrats, explaining not only that it made more sense to affiliate with the party that had a clear majority, but that he would have been largely excluded from the committee process had he not caucused with a party. King said he had not ruled out caucusing with the Republicans if they took control of the Senate in 2014, but when that happened, he remained in the Democratic caucus.


=== Tenure ===
The website That's My Congress places King ideologically in the "mushy middle" of the Senate, while the website On the Issues considers him a "left-liberal".
King supports reform of the Senate filibuster, noting that senators are no longer required to stand on the floor and speak during a filibuster. He also points out that the Constitution contains no 60-vote requirement to conduct business in the Senate. Accordingly, in 2013 King voted in favor of the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster for most presidential nominees.
King opposes attempts by the U.S. House to cut $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over ten years, fearing that it "would affect people in a serious way" and drive more people to soup kitchens and food banks. He supports the more modest Senate efforts to save $4 billion over the same period by closing loopholes.
King had stated that he would not have been willing to attend the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, due to threats against the Games. He further stated that he would not have wanted his family to attend either.
In 2014 King was chosen for the annual honor of reading George Washington's Farewell Address to the Senate.
King endorsed his colleague Susan Collins for reelection in the 2014 U.S. Senate election, calling her a "model Senator". At the same time, he endorsed Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire for reelection. King also endorsed Eliot Cutler for Governor in the 2014 election, as he had done in 2010, although on October 29, 2014, he switched his endorsement to Democratic nominee Mike Michaud. He also endorsed Democrat Emily Cain for the Maine's second congressional district election and Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee in his reelection campaign.
After Republicans gained the Senate majority in the November 4, 2014 election, King announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats. He cited his belief that it is good for a state to have a senator from each party, and that it is important to have a senator who caucuses with the same party as the President, saying, "In the end, who I caucus with is less important than who I work with." He further said, "It does not mean I have become a Democrat. It does not mean I have made a promise to anybody."
On June 22, 2015, King announced that he would undergo prostate cancer surgery on June 26, adding, "I'm looking forward to a full recovery and to continuing my service in the Senate". King had shown no symptoms but doctors had found the cancer in a routine medical exam, and after a biopsy was given, the diagnosis was confirmed. King also announced that this did not change his plans to run for reelection in 2018.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Armed Services
Subcommittee on Personnel
Subcommittee on Seapower
Subcommittee on Strategic Forces

Committee on the Budget
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
Subcommittee on Energy
Subcommittee on National Parks
Subcommittee on Water and Power

Committee on Rules and Administration
Select Committee on Intelligence


== Political positions ==
Angus King has described himself as "neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but an 'American.'" His Crowdpac score is -4.3 (10 is the most conservative, -10 the most liberal), based on a data aggregation of his campaign contributions, votes, and speeches. King votes with the majority of Democrats about 90% of the time. He has also received higher approval ratings from liberal interest groups than conservative ones. King has been rated 89% by the average liberal interest group; the average conservative interest group rates him 14.5%.


=== Economy ===
King has called for the continuation of a tariff on imported athletic footwear and rejects discussing the potential removal of the tariff in trade talks with Vietnam, citing the potential loss of jobs at New Balance's Skowhegan and Madison factories in Maine. New Balance is the only remaining domestic manufacturer of athletic footwear. Also while governor, King vetoed a bill that would have raised Maine's minimum wage by 25 cents per hour.


=== Oil ===
King is opposed to the Keystone XL pipeline, stating that the "project will facilitate the transport of some of the world's dirtiest and most climate-harming oil through our country" and has cast several votes against legislation authorizing its construction. King has said that he is "frustrated" with President Obama's delay in deciding whether to authorize construction, but that he opposes Congress legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project.


=== Syria ===
King has voted to arm Syrian rebels who are fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ISIL militants.


=== Iran deal ===
In September 2015 King voted against a resolution of disapproval of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran deal, after expressing support for the pact.


=== Environment ===
King opposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, believing the amount of oil is not worth the environmental risk of extracting it. He also believes that new developments in the energy field, such as fracking and the Keystone XL pipeline, should be subject to "all appropriate environmental safeguards to protect the American people and the American land."
King has expressed opposition to the creation of a Maine Woods National Park, believing that local control is the best way to conserve land, but in 2014 stated he was keeping an open mind about the idea. He has "serious reservations" about the designation of land in the Katahdin region as a National Monument.
King opposes efforts in Maine to ban the baiting and trapping of bears, including an effort to put the question to voters in 2014, calling such practices necessary to prevent interaction between bears and people, and stating the practices are based on science and the views of experts.


=== Veterans ===
King supports the Department of Veterans Affairs goal to eliminate both its claim backlog and veteran homelessness by 2015.


=== Education ===
King proposes supporting teacher development, by attempting to elevate the teaching profession to something attractive for top students. With over 29% of teachers claiming they are likely to leave the profession, King proposes steps such as creating a recruitment program, supporting research and development, and improving access to technology. He additionally proposes increasing parent involvement in the classroom, supporting measures like gas cards for parents.


=== Gun laws ===
King supports expanding background checks to most firearms transactions, with exceptions for transfers between family members, calling such a position "the single most effective step" that can be taken to keep guns out of the wrong hands. He supports limiting the size of magazines to 10 rounds, and to make purchasing a gun for someone not legally allowed to have one a federal crime. He does not support a ban on assault weapons, believing it will not work and that such a ban is not based on the functionality of the weapons, which are not relevantly different from the many hunting rifles owned by Maine residents. He further states that the vast majority of crimes are committed with handguns, not assault weapons.
King voted for the Manchin-Toomey amendment to expand background checks for gun purchases.


=== Health issues ===
King supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He is also pro-choice on abortion.
On September 27, 2013, King voted to restore funding for the Affordable Care Act as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days, which also omitted House-passed language prioritizing debt payments if Congress failed to increase the nation’s borrowing limits. He has said that those opposed to the ACA who are attempting to discourage people from purchasing health insurance are "guilty of murder" and that doing so was "one of the grossest violations of our humanity that I could think of." In making this comment, King noted a time in his life when he would have died had he not just acquired health insurance.


=== Same-sex marriage ===
King supports same-sex marriage, stating that it is "necessary to provide couples and their families with equal protection under the law." King also signed an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor encouraging it to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act.


== Awards and honors ==
The National Retail Federation gave King the 2014 "Hero of Main Street" award for his support of American retailers.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Expand the military **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: We have an obligation as the leaders of the world to maintain a strong military. And we have an obligation to our service personnel to pay them adequately. 
  * **Support** means you believe: We should consider carefully before making more cuts - for example, base closings have hurt local economies, and reducing military personnel has put pressure on employment. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Build smart, not necessarily big. Money is often better spent on issues other than defense. We should cut back on troops stationed abroad and focus on quality of our troops instead of quantity. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Defense spending includes huge amounts of pork-barrel spending and should be reduced dramatically. We should change our Defense policy to one of defense, instead of one where we police the world. Pull US troops out of Europe, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere. We are wrong to have a military that is as large as the rest of the world combined. 

This question is looking for your views on military spending in general.
However you answer the above question would be similar to your response to
these statements:

  * Improve military readiness 
  * Rebuild the `Hollow Military'
  * Maintain our troop commitments overseas
  * Men and women in the armed services are paid shamefully little
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of American strength abroad. 
  * **Support** means you believe that we need more spending to keep up with our **practical** national security requirements. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe that a better **practical** use of military funding would be on social programs or other domestic spending. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** that an overly-large US military hurts our security interests by making enemies abroad and destroying our economy in the long run. 

**

#### The War on Terrorism

[![](../images/afghanMap_detail.gif)](../images/afghanMap_detail.gif)

  * On **Sept. 11, 2001**, terrorists hijacked four commercial jets from Boston and Washington, and flew them into the World Trade Center in NYC and the Pentagon outside DC, destroying the Twin Towers and killing over 6,000 people. It was the worst terrorist incident in history. 
  * Pres. Bush appointed Tom Ridge as the "terrorism czar," formally creating a cabinet-level post for a new **Office of Homeland Security**, initially funding it with $40 billion. 
  * NATO invoked **Article 5** of its charter, which commits 18 European allies to military action in response to an attack on the homeland of the US. 
  * The primary suspect is **Osama bin Laden**, an exiled Saudi millionaire based in Afghanistan. 
  * The CIA formerly funded bin Laden as a leader of the **mujaheddin**, or freedom fighters, when the Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan through the 1980s. 
  * Bin Laden turned against the US when troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War in 1990. He issued a **fatwa**, or religious edict, calling for the removal of US troops from the Holy Lands of Mecca and Medina. 
  * Bin Laden's organization, **al Qaeda**, which means "The Base," funds terrorist training and operations, and has been implicated in past terrorist actions in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 2000 USS Cole bombing, and the 1998 simultaneous attack on two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
  * The US responded to the embassy bombings by a **cruise-missile attack** aimed at bin Laden, terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and chemical factories in Sudan. The US also by indicting bin Laden in US criminal court. 
  * **The Taliban** is the Muslim fundamentalist political party which rules most of Afghanistan. They were the largest army of the mujaheddin, and were also funded by the CIA in the 1980s. Their leader is Mullah Mohammad Omar. 
  * The Taliban rules under **Shari'ah**, or Islamic law as described in the Koran, which implies strict interpretation of moral codes and numerous personal restrictions. 
  * A portion of Afghanistan is ruled by the **Northern Alliance**, another mujaheddin group. Their leader was assassinated in the week preceding the World Trade Center attack; it is unknown whether there was a connection. 
  * The exiled king of Afghanistan, **Muhammad Zahir Shah,** has agreed to participate in a coalition government if the Taliban is overthrown. King Zahir is 86 years old, and has resided in Rome since 1973. 
  * Afghanistan's neighbors are: 
    * Pakistan (which shares the Afghan ethnicity of Pashtun in its northern provinces); 
    * Iran (which shares the Northern Alliance's religion of Shi'a Islam); 
    * Tajikistan (a former Soviet republic, which also has a Shi'a minority); 
    * Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (two other former Soviet republics; they are majority Sunni Muslim, like the Taliban); 
    * and China (bordering its Muslim province, known as Xinjiang in Chinese and Uighurstan in Arabic, where there are regular Islamic uprisings). 
  * The Taliban is recognized only by Pakistan; Saudi Arabia and Yemen, the only other countries to have recognized the Taliban, severed diplomatic ties in late September. 
  * **Pakistan** supplied the mujaheddin before and after the Soviet occupation. Complicating relations with the US, Pakistan exploded a nuclear device in 1998, in response to India's doing so. India and Pakistan have been fighting a sporadic war for decades over the Kashmir region.

#### History of Yugoslavia

[![](../images/YUGO_MAP.JPG)](../images/YUGO_BIG.JPG) Yugoslavia was created
after WWI, from a federation of Balkan countries. The intention was avoiding
further Balkan wars like those which ignited WWI. After WWII, its borders were
redrawn with six republics plus two provinces within Serbia. (click on the map
below left for an [enlarged view](YUGO_BIG.JPG)).

#### Sovereignty

The six Yugoslav republics (see below) have all had history as independent
nations. The two provinces within Serbia (Kosovo and Vojvodina) were never
independent, with legal status like California within the US. Hence much of
the debate on Kosovo centers on 'sovereignty' -- attacking Kosovo can be
viewed as an attack on the sovereignty of Serbia while it was involved in a
Civil War. Bosnia, on the other hand, had autonomous legal status like Puerto
Rico within the US. Bosnia had declared independence from Serbia before the US
sent troops there, and hence sovereignty was not an issue.

#### Marshal Tito

Marshal Tito was the Communist leader of Yugoslavia since WWII. He is credited
with holding the Yugoslav republics together (by dictatorial force), and after
he died in 1980 the republics began to clamor for more autonomy. Further
pressure for independence came from the fall of the Soviet empire in 1989.

#### Breakup of Yugoslavia

In 1990, a new Yugoslav Constitution was enacted. Four republics soon declared
independence, leaving 'Rump Yugoslavia' as only Serbia plus Montenegro. Status
of the former Yugoslav republics and provinces:

    1. **_Slovenia: **_ Declared independence in June 1991; one-week war with Serbia (a 'bloodless' war because Serbia focused on Croatia); Slovenia is now a prospering nation with hopes of joining NATO. 
    2. **_Croatia: **_ Declared independence in June 1991; longer war with Serbia; heavily involved with Bosnia war. 
    3. **_Macedonia: **_ Declared independence in Nov. 1991; avoided war because of arrival of international forces (including US forces, which are still based there). Greece has blocked full international recognition because the name 'Macedonia' is also the name of a Greek province. 
    4. **_Bosnia-Herzegovina: **_ Declared independence in 1992; lengthy war with Serbia and Croatia, with all three countries involved in 'ethnic cleansing.' The war ended with the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. US forces are still stationed in Bosnia, which is partitioned into three ethnic regions (Serb, Bosnian, & Croat). 
    5. **_Montenegro: **_ Still part of Yugoslavia as an autonomous Republic. Montenegrins are ethnically identical to Serbs; they differ only by geography. But in the wake of the Kosovo war, Montenegro may declare independence. 
    6. **_Serbia: **_ Legally, Serbia is just one republic of Yugoslavia. But the Serbs have always been the dominant group in all of Yugoslavia since is formation. 
    7. **_Kosovo: **_ Remains a province within the republic of Serbia. Its population is 3/4 Albanian (referred to as 'ethnic Albanians' to differentiate from residents of the neighboring country of Albania). 
    8. **_Vojvodina: **_ Also remains a province within the republic of Serbia. Its population is 1/2 Hungarian (they border Hungary, and prior to WWII were part of that country). 

#### Slobodan Milosevic

  * Milosevic came to power as Chairman of the Communist Party in 1986. 
  * His popularity increased greatly in 1987 after a speech in Kosovo strongly advocating Serbian nationalism (the speech was made on the site of a 14th century battlefield. This is the political basis for Milosevic not granting Kosovo independence). 
  * Milosevic was democratically elected President of Serbia in 1989, and elected as President of Yugoslavia in 1997. 
  * He was indicted as a war criminal in June 1999, the first time a sitting President has been indicted. His alleged crimes include genocide and ethnic cleansing. 
  * In October 2000, Milosevic lost the presidential election to Vlajislav Kostunica. Milosevic gave up power after widespread protests and Russian urging. 
  * In April 2001, Milosevic surrendered to Serbian government forces. He faces extradition to an international tribunal as well as domestic charges. 

#### Religion and Ethnicity

The major religious divisions in Yugoslavia explain much of the political
divisions:

  * _**Eastern Orthodoxy **_ is the religion of the Serbs, Macedonians, and Montenegrins. Hence Russia (who are also Eastern Orthodox and ethnically Slavic) support the Serbs, and Greece (who consider Macedonians ethnically Greek) identifies with Macedonia. 
  * _**Roman Catholicism **_ is the religion of the Croats, Slovenes, and Hungarians. Hence Croatia and Slovenia are religiously distinct from Serbia even though they are all ethnically Slavic. 
  * _**Islam **_ is the religion of the Bosnians and the Albanians (including those in Kosovo). Hence the country of Bosnia-Herzegovina is all ethnically Slavic but has three distinct religious groups. 

#### Kosovo

In 1999, the US and NATO negotiated with Milosevic in Rambouillet, France,
attempting to resolve the Kosovo crisis without ethnic cleansing or war. The
goal was to be a 'Rambouillet Agreement' fashioned after the Dayton Agreement
that ended the war in Bosnia. The peace talks failed, and NATO bombed Serbia
and Kosovo from March to June 1999. Milosevic capitulated; the Serbian Army
left Kosovo; and NATO, Russian, and UN troops are now stationed there under
the 'KFOR' banner.

#### Israel & Palestine

[![](../images/Israel_Map.gif)](../images/Israel_Map.gif)

  * 1948: The UN partitioned British Palestine into a Jewish state (Israel) and an Arab state (Palestine). Six Arab countries declared war on Israel; Israel survived with borders different than those drawn by the UN; these are now known as the "pre-1967 borders." Palestine did not survive; the East Bank and West Bank of the Jordan River were taken over by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip was taken over by Egypt. Many Palestinians became refugees in the 1948 war; they have still not been resettled and are the subject of the current debate on "right of return." 
  * 1956: Britain, France, & Israel invaded Egypt to force open the Suez Canal; they briefly occupied the Sinai Desert until pressured by the US and UN to withdraw. 
  * 1967: Israel won the "Six Day War" and occupied Gaza & Sinai (from Egypt); the West Bank (from Jordan); and the Golan Heights (from Syria). Jerusalem, split in 1948 between Israel & Palestine (and then Jordan), was unified under Israel; they annexed the whole city in 1980. 
  * 1973: A bloody war ended with no changed borders, but established the groundwork for an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979. Egypt's president, Anwar Sadat, shared with Israel's Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980 for his efforts, but paid for it with his life in an assassination in 1981. As part of the Egyptian peace treaty, Israel withdrew from Sinai (but not Gaza). The shaky peace has held up since, with regular US intervention and billions of dollars of annual US aid to both Egypt and Israel. 
  * 1982: Israel invaded Lebanon in response to terrorist attackes by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Israel surrounded the Lebanese capital, Beirut, forcing the PLO and its chairman, Yaserr Arafat, to withdraw. Israel began its withdrawl from Lebanon in 1985; Syria still occupies parts of the country. Israel also began establishing settlements on the West Bank in the late 1970s, which are a major point of contention in today's peace negotiations. 
  * 1987: Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank began an uprising against Israel, called "the Intifadeh." The PLO's Arafat signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, granting Palestine eventual self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank \-- this is the peace treaty which is still being phased in today. Jordan also signed a peace treaty with Israel, in 1994. 
  * 1996: Arafat is elected president of the "Palestinian Authority", and renounces the PLO Charter's clause calling for the destruction of Israel. In 1998, the Wye River Accords (under Pres. Clinton) negotiated further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. In 2000, a "Second Intifadeh" began in the West Bank; it continues today.

IRAQ HISTORY:  
  

  * Throughout most of the 1980s, Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war. It ended with no border changes, and without any US intervention. 
  * In 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, claiming it as a province of Iraq. The US and numerous allied assembled by Pres. George H. W. Bush built up a counterforce in Saudi Arabia and succeeded in 1991 in pushing Saddam's army out of Kuwait. 
  * On the 10th anniversary of the Gulf War, President-elect George W Bush declared Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein "a big threat" and said he must be contained - by military force if necessary. 
  * In Jan 2001, outgoing President Clinton signed and transmitted to Congress a report on the provision of assistance to the Iraqi opposition. The report outlines plans for the transfer of humanitarian assistance for the relief of the Iraqi people and for radio and television broadcasting by the Iraqi National Congress (INC). The report also identifies certain issues that must be resolved in relation to implementation of those plans. 
  * The primary purpose of the provision is to assist those Iraqis who have been displaced from their homes or who are not receiving adequate assistance from the UN and other assistance organizations. 
  * Kuwaiti society is still deeply conservative. A strong Islamic current runs through the country-Islamists are fairly well represented in parliament and there is the odd Islamic extremist attack, against video stores or women not wearing the veil.
