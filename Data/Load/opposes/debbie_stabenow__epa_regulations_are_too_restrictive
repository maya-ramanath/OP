Deborah Ann "Debbie" Greer Stabenow (born April 29, 1950) is the senior United States Senator from Michigan and a member of the Democratic Party. Before her election to the U.S. Senate, she was a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Michigan's 8th congressional district from 1997 to 2001. She previously served as a member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, Michigan House of Representatives, and Michigan Senate.
Stabenow served as Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee 2011-2015. She was re-elected to the seat for a third term in November 2012. She became the state's senior senator upon the retirement of Carl Levin on January 3, 2015.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
Stabenow was born in Gladwin, Michigan, the daughter of Anna Merle (née Hallmark) and Robert Lee Greer. She grew up in Clare, Michigan. She graduated from Clare High School, and received a Bachelor of Arts from Michigan State University in 1972 and a Master of Social Work magna cum laude from Michigan State University in 1975.


== Early political career ==


=== Ingham County politics ===
While in graduate school, Stabenow won her first election to public office: the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, a position in which she served from 1975 to 1978.


=== State legislature ===
She served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1979 to 1990, where she became the first woman to preside over the House. She also served in the Michigan Senate from 1991 to 1994.


=== 1994 gubernatorial election ===

In 1994, she ran for Governor of Michigan in the Democratic primary, for the opportunity to challenge incumbent Republican John Engler. However, U.S. Congressman Howard Wolpe defeated her in the primary with a plurality of 35% to Stabenow's 30%. After the primary, Wolpe chose Stabenow as his running mate, and she appeared on the general election ballot as the Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor. Stabenow failed to become Lieutenant Governor of Michigan as Engler defeated Wolpe 61%-38%.


=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
In 1996, she decided to run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. She challenged incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Dick Chrysler of Michigan's 8th congressional district. She defeated him 54%-44%. In 1998, she won re-election to a second term with 57% of the vote.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== Elections ===
2000

She did not seek re-election in 2000 in order to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham. She won the Democratic primary unopposed. She was considered the underdog for much of the Senate race, but rallied in the final weeks. She defeated him 49.5%-48%, a difference of 67,259 votes.
2006

Stabenow was challenged by Republican Michael Bouchard, Oakland County sheriff and former State Senate Majority Leader. Stabenow defeated him 57%-41%.
2012

Stabenow was unopposed in the Democratic primary and defeated Republican nominee Pete Hoekstra, former U.S. representative. Stabenow won 59% to Hoekstra's 38%.


=== Tenure ===
Before her current committee assignments, Senator Stabenow also served on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the Special Committee on Aging.
Stabenow is only the second person from Michigan to have served in both houses of the Michigan State Legislature and in both houses of the United States Congress. Stabenow is also the first person to have served as a Michigan state legislator to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate (until enactment of the Seventeenth amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, U.S. Senators were selected by the state legislature). No former Michigan state legislator had served in the U.S. Senate since 1894, when Francis B. Stockbridge died.
Stabenow became the third-ranking Democratic Party member in the U.S. Senate on November 16, 2004, when she was elected as secretary of the Democratic caucus. As caucus secretary, she assisted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) to set the Democratic agenda and priorities. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) was elected Minority Whip, the second-ranking Democratic spot. In November 2006, Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that Stabenow would leave the caucus secretary position to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, charged with "engag[ing] Democratic Senators and community leaders across the country in an active dialogue".
Following the withdrawal of Tom Daschle as President Barack Obama's nominee as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Organization for Women endorsed Stabenow for the position and urged the president to appoint Stabenow, saying, "Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) has long focused on health care as a priority, and with her background as a social worker she is well positioned to take the helm of this agency that is so critical to women and families."
Stabenow became the Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2011, following the defeat of Chairwoman Blanche Lincoln. A controversial item during Stabenow's tenure, has been the renewal and reform of the 2012 U.S. Farm Bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) demonstrated his commitment to working on a new five-year Farm Bill by reintroducing 2012's Senate Farm Bill in the new 113th Congress in January 2013. Senator Reid indicated that the Farm Bill is on his top priority list, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Stabenow has voiced support for Reid’s move stating, "Majority Leader Reid has demonstrated that the Senate will once again make supporting our nation’s agriculture economy while cutting spending a top priority." 
On October 29, 2014, Stabenow introduced the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act (S. 1603; 113th Congress), a bill that would reaffirm the status of lands taken into trust by the Department of the Interior (DOI) for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band. The bill would clarify that the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band's land trust could not be challenged in court under the Supreme Court decision of Carcieri v. Salazar.

== Political positions ==
Fairness doctrine
Stabenow has expressed support in regulating talk radio via a measure like the Fairness doctrine. On February 5, 2009, she stated "I think it’s absolutely time to pass a standard. Now, whether it’s called the Fairness Standard, whether it’s called something else — I absolutely think it’s time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves." Her support for these measures has been met with criticism about a conflict of interest, given that the primary target is conservative talk radio and that her former husband, Tom Athans, has been an executive at a number of liberal progressive talk radio networks, such as Air America
Drilling in the Great Lakes
She authored the first law to ban drilling in the Great Lakes.
On August 31, 2006, Stabenow, along with Senator Carl Levin and Rep. John Dingell, announced an agreement that would completely cease Ontario's dumping of solid waste in Michigan within four years. This has been an issue in Michigan for the past several years. Previously in the Senate, Stabenow wrote legislation intended to reduce the dumping of Canadian trash into Michigan by requiring machines to search trash being dumped across the border. In July 2006, the Senate unanimously passed a law sponsored by Stabenow requiring the payment of $420 inspection fee for every truckload of Canadian trash being brought into Michigan.
Global warming
On August 10, 2009, Stabenow was reported by The Detroit News as saying "Global warming creates volatility. I feel it when I'm flying. The storms are more volatile. We are paying the price in more hurricanes and tornadoes." However, she has opposed regulation of greenhouse gases, enhanced fuel efficiency standards in California, and greenhouse gas emission reporting standards.
Health care reform
Stabenow supported President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; she voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and she voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. She also sponsored S. 2257: Excellence in Mental Health Act.
Defense
Stabenow voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 in December 2011, which included highly controversial provisions drafted by Senators Carl Levin and John McCain in closed session, that allows for the indefinite military detention of American citizens who are deemed potential terrorists and enemies of the state without trial, challenging the general judicial status of "innocent until proven guilty."
Environment
In March 2011, the Think Progress website criticized Stabenow for joining “the pro-polluter frenzy sweeping the U.S. Senate, introducing legislation to permanently cripple Clean Air Act rules on global warming pollution. The legislation in question was the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S.493), which, according to Think Progress, was “being used as a vehicle for senators who wish to prevent regulation of greenhouse pollution from oil refineries, coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, and other major emitters. Stabenow has added her amendment to three others intended to hamstring the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of carbon polluters.”
Stabenow's proposed amendment to keep the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions for two years also draw criticism. The amendment would have given “coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and other industrial sources a two year exemption” from rules requiring them to report greenhouse gas emissions. Stabenow defended her position by saying “My amendment is a common-sense approach that allows protections from carbon pollution, determined by scientists and public health experts, to continue being developed while providing businesses the support and incentives they need as they reduce pollution, generate new clean energy technologies and create jobs.”
The Economy
In 2009, Stabenow voted for President Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan. In 2008, however, she voted against the bailout proposed by President Bush.
Same Sex Marriage
Stabenow is for the equal rights of the LGBT community in the U.S. On two separate occasions she has voted against the Constitutional Amendment, 2004 and 2006, to define marriage “as between one man and one woman". In 2006, Stabenow also voted NO on the constitutional ban of same sex marriage.


== Criticism ==
In 2009, Stabenow said, “I have always said that a strong, national fuel-economy standard is what our country needs, not a confusing patch work of different state standards. I am pleased that the Obama administration heeded my call and developed a national standard for our automakers to follow — a clear standard that will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil." However, an article from The Washington Independent states that her voting record "tells a different tale." In 2002, she voted against "a proposal that would have forced automakers to create vehicles with fleetwide averages of 40 miles-per-gallon by 2015 — 'a strong, national fuel economy standard'." Also, in June 2007, she voted against a bill that would mandate "fleet-wide averages of 35 mpg by 2020."


== Personal life ==
Stabenow was first married to Dennis Stabenow; the couple divorced in 1990. They have two children, Michelle and Todd.
In 2003, Stabenow married Tom Athans, now co-founder of Democracy Radio and former executive vice president of Air America. By this marriage, she has a stepdaughter, Gina. In 2008, Athans said to the police that he had used the internet “to make a date with a prostitute and paid her $150 for sex at a hotel” in Detroit. The news came about after police investigations into an internet-based prostitution ring operating in the hotel questioned Athans. Stabenow and Athans divorced on May 28, 2010, approximately two years after Athans was detained in Troy, Michigan, as part of a prostitution sting.
Stabenow belongs to the Grace United Methodist Church.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** EPA regulations are too restrictive **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: The earth is humankind's domain to do with as we see fit. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Human needs come first, but it's ok to account for environmental needs after human needs are accounted for. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: We should balance animal rights with human needs, accounting for nature's value for humans as well as for other environmental benefits. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Animals have inherent rights, and nature has inherent value. 

This question is looking for your views on environmentalism both under
economic terms and " under the 5th Amendment.  However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * No 'rights' to clean air and water 
  * "Sustainability" is a codeword for "Socialism" 
  * In Gen.1:26, God promised Man dominion over the earth and all its resources. 
  * The "takings clause" of the Constitution prohibits eminent domain for most reasons. 
  * You cannot sue a company for polluting 
  * Wise Use 
  * Human needs over animal rights 
  * There's plenty of room for animals; right next to the mashed potatoes on my plate. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you oppose the **principle** of environmentalism, and you believe in the **principle** of placing human needs first. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** methods of natural resource use. You prioritize people first, but goals can be accomplished with respect for nature. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe **practical** compromise between economic needs and environmental needs. You might cite that Gen.1:26 properly uses the term "stewardship," implying caretaker status, rather than "dominion," implying ownership status. You cite "sustainability" as the rationale for environmental action; and recognize that hunters and anglers are your potential allies. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of animal rights and the **principle** of the value of nature for its own sake. You support vegetarianism; take pride in the title of "tree-hugger"; and abhor hunting. You cite morality (rather than sustainability) as the rationale for environmental action. 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

**Environment and Energy**   
Energy issues have so dominated the 2012 election that all other environmental
issues have fallen aside. In fact, the term "environmental issues" in this
election cycle has come to mean "energy issues." In this section, we stick to
non-energy environmental issues -- see our [Energy & Oil](Energy_+_Oil.htm)
section for the energy-based issues. Some hot topics in the 2012 election
cycle:

  * **_Yucca Mountain:**_ A federally-owned mountain in Nevada which the federal government has proposed as a long-term repository for nuclear waste. Yucca Mountain was selected because, in theory, it is geologically stable enough to survive intact for the tens of thousands of years until the nuclear waste becomes harmless. The site was first proposed under President Reagan in 1985-1987; Congress approved it under President Bush in 2002; and then Congress canceled the program under President Obama in April 2011. 

  * **_Big Dig:**_ The "Big Dig" refers to Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project, conducted in large part while Mitt ROmney was governor of Massachusetts. The Big Dig converted an elevated highway, I-93, into a 3.5 mile tunnel through central Boston, and added a third tunnel under Boston Harbor to Logan Airport. The original cost of the project in 1998 was proposed at $3 billion; it grew into a $22 billion project by the latest 2012 estimate. In addition to several construction deaths, a motorist was killed when a section of ceiling collapsed in 2006, attributed to inappropriate glue to hold up the concrete ceiling. The project was also plagued by water leaks for several years, attributed to failure to meet contract specifications. 

  * **_Conservation Easements:**_ Refers to land deeds which restrict future usage of the parcel of land to protect habitat, ban hunting or logging, or otherwise meet conservation goals. Also known as "Land Trusts," they have been tremendously successful in preserving open space and wildlife habitat. To assure that open space and habitat will be there for future generations, Congress provided targeted income tax relief to small farmers and ranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified conservation easement. 

  * **_Green Jobs:**_ "Green Jobs" refers to subsidizing environmentally-friendly industries, usually alternative energy. 

Every recent president, including Obama, has promised "green jobs" in their
State of the Union speeches; but the only action so far has been to mention it
again in the subsequent year's State of the Union message.

"Solyndra" has become shorthand for "cronyism in the name of green jobs."
Solyndra declared bankruptcy in Sept. 2011 after receiving a $527 million
federal loan to support commercial-scale manufacturing for its solar
photovoltaic panels. Romney visited the abandoned Solyndra factory in May 2012
to criticize Obama's policy.  
**Endangered Species**
  * **_Endangered Species Act (ESA):**_ 1973 law prohibiting activities that harm endangered plants or animals or their habitats. Which species are threatened & endangered are listed or delisted by the Secretaries of Interior & Commerce. The controversy comes from limitations on private property to protect one species. 

  * **_Takings:**_ The federal government is allowed to take private property when it serves the public interest (via eminent domain) but must pay fair market value. When the ESA regulates private property use (such as disallowing development), the value is decreased even though the property is not fully taken. The takings controversy concerns how much the government should pay to property owners when their property is only partially taken. 
**Pollution Control vs. Cost Control**
  * **_The Clean Air Act:**_ (CAA) regulates industrial smokestacks and other sources of smog, acid rain, and other air pollutants. The CAA uses numerous market incentives, including pollution permits that are traded on open markets, to minimize costs. 

  * **_The Clean Water Act:**_ (CWA) regulates point-source (sewage pipes) and non-point-source (land and road runoff) water pollution. The EPAs approach since the early 1990s is watershed-based, which means cooperating across political boundaries. 

  * **_CAFE standard:**_ The Corporate Average Fuel Economy requires that all automobile manufacturers maintain an average of 28 miles per gallon (mpg) for all vehicles sold. 

  * **_Command-and-control:**_ Standardized regulations with central enforcement (usually by EPA), as opposed to market-based incentives. 
**Federal Lands**   
The federal government owns 27% of all US land (more than the combined area of
Alaska, Texas, & California).

  1. **_BLM:**_ The Bureau of Land Management owns 270 million acres of cattle grazing land. 
  2. **_USFS:**_ The US Forest Service owns 185 million acres of timber land. 
  3. **_FWS:**_ The Fish & Wildlife Service owns 90 million acres of waterways and surrounding lands. 
  4. **_NPS:**_ The National Park Service owns 75 million acres of national parks and national rivers. 
  5. **_States:**_ State and local governments own 200 million acres of land (another 9% of total US land area). 
**Land Use Buzzwords**
  * **_Devolution:**_ Some candidates believe that land use decisions should devolve from the federal government to state or local government, to encourage community involvement. 
  * **_Wise Use:**_ A code word which means stop federal land use restrictions. It comes from the Forest Services founding doctrines, which say that wise land use includes commercial use plus recreational use. 
  * **_Land Trusts:**_ Privately-held land which has restrictions on development (e.g., wildlife sanctuaries). 
  * **_Suburban Sprawl:**_ Uncontrolled development that fosters automobile usage rather than mass transit. 
  * **_Urban Redevelopment:**_ Restoring inner-city blighted communities via empowerment zones, etc. 
  * **_Brownfields:**_ Locating industrial development on former waste sites (versus wide-open greenfields). 
  * **_Superfund:**_ EPA cleanup of toxic waste sites. 

> **Amendment V to the US Constitution**  
> ...nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation.(1791)
