Sheldon Whitehouse (born October 20, 1955) is an American politician and the junior United States Senator from Rhode Island, serving since 2007. He is a member of the Democratic Party and previously served as a United States Attorney from 1993 to 1998 and as the Attorney General of Rhode Island from 1999 to 2003.


== Early life, education, and pre-political career ==
Whitehouse was born in New York City, New York, the son of Mary Celine (née Rand) and career diplomat Charles Sheldon Whitehouse, and grandson of diplomat Sheldon Whitehouse. He graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and from Yale University in 1978. He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1982.
Whitehouse worked as a clerk for Judge Richard F. Neely of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia from 1982 to 1983. He also worked in the Rhode Island Attorney General's office as a special assistant attorney general from 1985 to 1990, chief of the Regulatory Unit (which oversaw utilities) from 1988 to 1990, and also an assistant attorney general from 1989 to 1990.
Whitehouse worked as Rhode Island Governor Bruce Sundlun's Executive Counsel beginning in 1991, and was later tapped to serve as Director of Policy. He oversaw the state's response to the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC) banking crisis, which took place right after Sundlun took office. Whitehouse was appointed by Sundlun to be the state's Director of Business Regulation in 1992, where he oversaw a drastic reform in the state's workers' compensation insurance system.


== Early political career ==


=== U.S. Attorney ===
President Bill Clinton appointed Whitehouse United States Attorney for Rhode Island in 1994. Whitehouse held the position for four years, and was the first prosecutor to convict a member of organized crime under Clinton's "three strikes law". Whitehouse also initiated the investigation into municipal corruption in Rhode Island that led to Operation Plunder Dome, in which Mayor of Providence Vincent "Buddy" Cianci was eventually convicted on conspiracy charges. As US Attorney for Rhode Island, Whitehouse oversaw an increase in environmental protection efforts, including an investigation into a Narragansett Bay oil spill that yielded the largest fine in state history.


=== State Attorney General ===
In 1998, Whitehouse was elected Rhode Island Attorney General. He initiated a lawsuit against the lead paint industry that ended in a mistrial; the state later won a second lawsuit against former lead paint manufacturers Sherwin Williams Co., Millennium Holdings, and NL Industries that found them responsible for creating a public nuisance. This decision, however, was unanimously overturned by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on July 1, 2008. The Court found that under Rhode Island law it is the responsibility of property owners to abate and mitigate lead hazards.
Whitehouse also founded the Rhode Island Quality Institute, "an organization dedicated to improving health care quality in the State of Rhode Island". He also authorized the first Rhode Island State Police wiretap to investigate public corruption.
Whitehouse's tenure as attorney general also saw some controversy. When black Providence police officer Cornel Young Jr. was shot and killed by two fellow officers while he was off-duty in January 2000, Whitehouse was criticized for not appointing an independent prosecutor to investigate the shooting. Later that year, Whitehouse was criticized when 15-year-old Jennifer Rivera, a witness in a murder case, was shot by a relative of the man she was to testify against later that year. After Rivera's shooting, Whitehouse strengthened the state's witness protection program.


=== 2002 gubernatorial election ===
Whitehouse was defeated in the Democratic primary by former State Senator and three-time failed gubernatorial candidate Myrth York, who was unsuccessful in the general election against Republican Donald Carcieri.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== Elections ===
2006

In 2006, Whitehouse ran for the seat occupied by Senator Lincoln Chafee, a Republican seeking a second full term. After winning the Democratic primary by a large margin, Whitehouse went on to defeat Chafee with 53 percent of the vote.
2012

On November 6, 2012, Sheldon Whitehouse won reelection to a second term in office, easily defeating GOP challenger Barry Hinckley, "both in state results and in local towns. Whitehouse won by 30 points, with 64.9 percent of the vote in Rhode Island".


=== Tenure ===
Whitehouse voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Budget Control Act. He voted against Cut, Cap and Balance and the debt ceiling increase. Earlier in his first term, he voted for the Stimulus package and the TARP. He voted against cap and trade, but sponsored Offshoring Prevention and supported the Global Warming Reduction Act. 
In traditionally liberal Rhode Island, both the Democratic Whitehouse and his predecessor, Republican Lincoln Chafee, hold liberal political positions. But Whitehouse has been to the left of Chafee on economic issues, a position that separated him from his opponent in the last election. In 2007, Whitehouse was ranked the second-most liberal senator by the National Journal.
Whitehouse supports stem cell research, abortion rights, LGBT rights and gay marriage, as well as affirmative action. He has publicly supported a reintroduction of the Equal Rights Amendment. Like Chafee, Whitehouse opposed intervention in Iraq (Chafee was the only Republican senator to vote against it).
He voted to confirm Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, but opposed the nomination of Samuel Alito.
Whitehouse supports a more progressive tax system and strongly opposed the Bush tax cuts and proposals to repeal the Estate Tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He is in favor of gun control and has spoken out against the Patriot Act. Whitehouse supported introducing a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, stating that the United States must use caution in the future and avoid engaging in military action in Iran.
Despite a generally pro-rehabilitation stance on crime, Whitehouse supports the federal use of the death penalty, but opposes its use at the state level in Rhode Island. Whitehouse also opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and other similar proposals. He has styled himself as a supporter of fair trade and is opposed to using presidential authority to "fast-track" normalized trade relations.
In addition, Whitehouse has stated that he does not want torture abuse by the Bush administration to be "papered over", and supports a commission to uncover its war crimes.
Whitehouse has faced some criticism for alleged insider trading, avoiding big losses by trading stocks after top federal officials warned congressional leaders of "the coming economic cataclysm" in September 2008.
PolitiFact determined that Whitehouse falsely claimed Paul Ryan's 2012 budget blueprint "gets rid of Medicare in 10 years." Whitehouse claimed to have meant that Ryan's plan would have ended Medicare "as we know it", turning it into a voucher program.


==== Health care ====
During the passing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Whitehouse cautioned that conservative opposition to the bill was moving toward historical incidences of mob violence, saying, "Too many colleagues are embarked on a desperate, no-holds-barred mission of propaganda, obstruction and fear...cautions us of the excesses to which these malignant, vindictive passions can ultimately lead. Tumbrils have rolled through taunting crowds. Broken glass has sparkled in darkened streets. Strange fruit has hung from southern trees".
In December 2009, Whitehouse said "birthers", "fanatics", and "people running around in right-wing militia and Aryan support groups" oppose Obamacare.


==== Environmental issues ====
In November 2011, ThinkProgress reported Whitehouse's introduction of a bill that would require federal natural resource agencies to be concerned with the long-term effects of climate change, and to encourage preparation of natural resource adaptation plans by the states. The Safeguarding America’s Future and Environment Act (SAFE) Act also "would create a science advisory board to ensure that the planning uses the best available science”.
In reference to the proposed action on mandatory emissions curbs, Whitehouse told The Hill that "I am not hearing anybody on our side, even the people who are more economically concerned about the climate legislation who come from coal states, that sort of thing, saying, 'What are we going to say about this, is this a problem?'"
Whitehouse dismissed Climategate: “Climategate should properly be known as Climategate-gate because it was the scandal that was phony.”
In May 2011 Whitehouse introduced legislation to support coastal jobs and protect oceans. The National Endowment for the Oceans, Coasts, and Great Lakes Act (S.973) is pending.
Environmental Defense Fund praised him for working to protect the Gulf Coast wetlands.
Whitehouse has said that development of alternate energy sources, including solar power, will eliminate U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He has cited the installation of new solar panels on three new bank branches in Rhode Island, saying that the projects “created jobs, they put people to work, they lowered the cost for these banks of their electrical energy, and they get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply”. In regard to these comments, PolitiFact investigated the economics of renewable energy and determined that solar and wind investments would not have a large effect on oil consumption, calling Whitehouse's comments "mostly false" due to "this misimpression—and because of the other inaccuracies in Whitehouse’s speech".
On November 14, 2013, Whitehouse gave his 50th weekly Senate speech on climate change. The series of speeches highlights the science of climate change and offers paths for the United States to take strong action.
In a May 29, 2015, Washington Post editorial, Whitehouse advocated prosecution of members of the fossil fuel industry under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), in order to investigate their interest in anti-global-warming advocacy.


==== U.S. Attorney controversy ====

Whitehouse received notice in a June 2007 opinion piece from Los Angeles Times journalist and senior editorial writer Michael McGough for Whitehouse's careful questioning and thoughtful statements, and his understanding that the less said, the more effective his efforts may be. McGough cited this statement by Whitehouse about President George W. Bush's "crony" (McGough's word) Attorney General Alberto Gonzales: "[Gonzales's] stated definition of what is improper for him and his staff, believe it or not, tracks the legal standard for criminal obstruction of justice. Is that the kind of attorney general we want?"
In the spring of 2007, Whitehouse joined other Senators in pressuring for Gonzales's resignation. After Gonzales's first appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee related to the controversy, Whitehouse told NPR, "[Gonzales] had a hard sell to make to me, and he didn't make it." He continued to question Gonzales's service in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.


=== Committee assignments ===
Whitehouse is a member of the following committees:
Committee on the Budget
Committee on Environment and Public Works
Subcommittee on Oversight
Subcommittee on Superfund, Toxics and Environmental Health
Subcommittee on Water and Wildlife (Ranking Member)

Committee on the Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism (Ranking Member)
Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law

Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee
Special Committee on Aging
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe
International Narcotics Control Caucus
Impeachment Trial Committee on the Articles against Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. 
On August 3, 2007, it was announced that Whitehouse would receive the Golden Gavel award, having presided over Senate debates for more than 100 hours in his first six months in office.


=== Caucus memberships ===
Healthy Kids Caucus
International Conservation Caucus (Co-Chair)
International Narcotics Control Caucus
Senate Oceans Caucus (Co-Chair)


== Electoral history ==


== United States Attorney General and U.S. Supreme Court speculation ==
Upon Attorney General Eric Holder's announcement in September 2014 of his intention to step down, some speculated that Whitehouse could be nominated as Holder's replacement.
In February 2016, after the death of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, USA Today named Whitehouse as a possible nominee to fill the vacancy. Whitehouse's service as a U.S. Attorney and as Attorney General of Rhode Island gives him both legislative experience and experience as a legal official, though not as a judge.


== Personal life ==
In 1986 Whitehouse married Sandra Thornton, a marine biologist and granddaughter of James Worth Thornton and Elena Mumm Thornton Wilson. Her step-grandfather was prominent essayist and critic Edmund Wilson. They live in Rhode Island with their two children, Molly Whitehouse and Alexander "Xander" Whitehouse.
Whitehouse is a descendent of William Bradford, colonial governor of Massachusetts, as well as theologian Archibald Alexander, Episcopal bishop Henry John Whitehouse, and railroad executive Charles Crocker.
After meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in September 2008, Whitehouse came under scrutiny due to possible insider trading, when he sold a number of positions, valued at least at $250,000, over the next six days. Whitehouse was trading anywhere from 5–20% of his net worth. In Senate candidate Barry Hinckley's book, he said that it was "implausible that much of someone’s net worth would be traded without someone’s knowledge". A spokesperson for Whitehouse's office explained that the senator "is not actively involved in the management" of the accounts implicated, and that he "neither directed his financial advisor to undertake any transaction during that time, nor ever took advantage of any exclusive or secret information".

**VoteMatch**   
  
** EPA regulations are too restrictive **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: The earth is humankind's domain to do with as we see fit. 
  * **Support** means you believe: Human needs come first, but it's ok to account for environmental needs after human needs are accounted for. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: We should balance animal rights with human needs, accounting for nature's value for humans as well as for other environmental benefits. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: Animals have inherent rights, and nature has inherent value. 

This question is looking for your views on environmentalism both under
economic terms and " under the 5th Amendment.  However you answer the above
question would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * No 'rights' to clean air and water 
  * "Sustainability" is a codeword for "Socialism" 
  * In Gen.1:26, God promised Man dominion over the earth and all its resources. 
  * The "takings clause" of the Constitution prohibits eminent domain for most reasons. 
  * You cannot sue a company for polluting 
  * Wise Use 
  * Human needs over animal rights 
  * There's plenty of room for animals; right next to the mashed potatoes on my plate. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you oppose the **principle** of environmentalism, and you believe in the **principle** of placing human needs first. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** methods of natural resource use. You prioritize people first, but goals can be accomplished with respect for nature. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe **practical** compromise between economic needs and environmental needs. You might cite that Gen.1:26 properly uses the term "stewardship," implying caretaker status, rather than "dominion," implying ownership status. You cite "sustainability" as the rationale for environmental action; and recognize that hunters and anglers are your potential allies. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of animal rights and the **principle** of the value of nature for its own sake. You support vegetarianism; take pride in the title of "tree-hugger"; and abhor hunting. You cite morality (rather than sustainability) as the rationale for environmental action.

****BACKGROUND**

**Environment and Energy**   
Energy issues have so dominated the 2012 election that all other environmental
issues have fallen aside. In fact, the term "environmental issues" in this
election cycle has come to mean "energy issues." In this section, we stick to
non-energy environmental issues -- see our [Energy & Oil](Energy_+_Oil.htm)
section for the energy-based issues. Some hot topics in the 2012 election
cycle:

  * **_Yucca Mountain:**_ A federally-owned mountain in Nevada which the federal government has proposed as a long-term repository for nuclear waste. Yucca Mountain was selected because, in theory, it is geologically stable enough to survive intact for the tens of thousands of years until the nuclear waste becomes harmless. The site was first proposed under President Reagan in 1985-1987; Congress approved it under President Bush in 2002; and then Congress canceled the program under President Obama in April 2011. 

  * **_Big Dig:**_ The "Big Dig" refers to Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project, conducted in large part while Mitt ROmney was governor of Massachusetts. The Big Dig converted an elevated highway, I-93, into a 3.5 mile tunnel through central Boston, and added a third tunnel under Boston Harbor to Logan Airport. The original cost of the project in 1998 was proposed at $3 billion; it grew into a $22 billion project by the latest 2012 estimate. In addition to several construction deaths, a motorist was killed when a section of ceiling collapsed in 2006, attributed to inappropriate glue to hold up the concrete ceiling. The project was also plagued by water leaks for several years, attributed to failure to meet contract specifications. 

  * **_Conservation Easements:**_ Refers to land deeds which restrict future usage of the parcel of land to protect habitat, ban hunting or logging, or otherwise meet conservation goals. Also known as "Land Trusts," they have been tremendously successful in preserving open space and wildlife habitat. To assure that open space and habitat will be there for future generations, Congress provided targeted income tax relief to small farmers and ranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified conservation easement. 

  * **_Green Jobs:**_ "Green Jobs" refers to subsidizing environmentally-friendly industries, usually alternative energy. 

Every recent president, including Obama, has promised "green jobs" in their
State of the Union speeches; but the only action so far has been to mention it
again in the subsequent year's State of the Union message.

"Solyndra" has become shorthand for "cronyism in the name of green jobs."
Solyndra declared bankruptcy in Sept. 2011 after receiving a $527 million
federal loan to support commercial-scale manufacturing for its solar
photovoltaic panels. Romney visited the abandoned Solyndra factory in May 2012
to criticize Obama's policy.  
**Endangered Species**
  * **_Endangered Species Act (ESA):**_ 1973 law prohibiting activities that harm endangered plants or animals or their habitats. Which species are threatened & endangered are listed or delisted by the Secretaries of Interior & Commerce. The controversy comes from limitations on private property to protect one species. 

  * **_Takings:**_ The federal government is allowed to take private property when it serves the public interest (via eminent domain) but must pay fair market value. When the ESA regulates private property use (such as disallowing development), the value is decreased even though the property is not fully taken. The takings controversy concerns how much the government should pay to property owners when their property is only partially taken. 
**Pollution Control vs. Cost Control**
  * **_The Clean Air Act:**_ (CAA) regulates industrial smokestacks and other sources of smog, acid rain, and other air pollutants. The CAA uses numerous market incentives, including pollution permits that are traded on open markets, to minimize costs. 

  * **_The Clean Water Act:**_ (CWA) regulates point-source (sewage pipes) and non-point-source (land and road runoff) water pollution. The EPAs approach since the early 1990s is watershed-based, which means cooperating across political boundaries. 

  * **_CAFE standard:**_ The Corporate Average Fuel Economy requires that all automobile manufacturers maintain an average of 28 miles per gallon (mpg) for all vehicles sold. 

  * **_Command-and-control:**_ Standardized regulations with central enforcement (usually by EPA), as opposed to market-based incentives. 
**Federal Lands**   
The federal government owns 27% of all US land (more than the combined area of
Alaska, Texas, & California).

  1. **_BLM:**_ The Bureau of Land Management owns 270 million acres of cattle grazing land. 
  2. **_USFS:**_ The US Forest Service owns 185 million acres of timber land. 
  3. **_FWS:**_ The Fish & Wildlife Service owns 90 million acres of waterways and surrounding lands. 
  4. **_NPS:**_ The National Park Service owns 75 million acres of national parks and national rivers. 
  5. **_States:**_ State and local governments own 200 million acres of land (another 9% of total US land area). 
**Land Use Buzzwords**
  * **_Devolution:**_ Some candidates believe that land use decisions should devolve from the federal government to state or local government, to encourage community involvement. 
  * **_Wise Use:**_ A code word which means stop federal land use restrictions. It comes from the Forest Services founding doctrines, which say that wise land use includes commercial use plus recreational use. 
  * **_Land Trusts:**_ Privately-held land which has restrictions on development (e.g., wildlife sanctuaries). 
  * **_Suburban Sprawl:**_ Uncontrolled development that fosters automobile usage rather than mass transit. 
  * **_Urban Redevelopment:**_ Restoring inner-city blighted communities via empowerment zones, etc. 
  * **_Brownfields:**_ Locating industrial development on former waste sites (versus wide-open greenfields). 
  * **_Superfund:**_ EPA cleanup of toxic waste sites. 

> **Amendment V to the US Constitution**  
> ...nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation.(1791)
