Joseph Simon "Joe" Donnelly, Sr. (born September 29, 1955) is an American politician who is the junior United States Senator from Indiana. A member of the Democratic Party, Donnelly has served in the Senate since January 3, 2013.
Born in Massapequa, New York, Donnelly graduated from The University of Notre Dame. He began his career serving on the Indiana State Election Board before working as an attorney in practice. From 1997 to 2001, he was a member of the Mishawaka Marian School Board, serving as the board's President from 2000 to 2001. In 2004, Donnelly ran for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing to Republican incumbent Chris Chocola in the general election. He challenged Chocola to a rematch in 2006, prevailing in the general election and earning 54% of the vote. He was elected to a total of three terms, winning reelection in 2008 and 2010; representing Indiana's 2nd congressional district from 2007 to 2013.
In May 2011, Donnelly announced his intentions to run for the U.S. Senate, winning the Democratic nomination one year later in an uncontested primary. He faced Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, who had defeated 36-year incumbent Richard Lugar in the Republican primary. On November 6, 2012 Donnelly defeated Mourdock in the general election, securing 50% of the vote to Mourdock's 44%.


== Early life, education, and law career ==
Donnelly was born and raised on the South Shore of Long Island in Massapequa, New York. Donnelly moved to South Bend, Indiana in 1973 when he was accepted into the University of Notre Dame, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Government in 1977, and earned his Juris Doctor from Notre Dame Law School in 1981. He practiced law at the Nemeth, Feeney and Masters law firm until 1996, when he opened Marking Solutions, a printing and rubber-stamp company.


== Early political career ==
Donnelly held one public and one private position before deciding to run for U.S. Congress. From 1988 to 1989 he served on the Indiana State Election Board, which was charged with ensuring accurate election results. He served on the Marian High School Board from 1997 to 2001, serving as president of the board of the Catholic school from 2000 to 2001.
He ran a campaign for Indiana Attorney General in 1988, but lost at the Democratic state convention. He also ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Indiana Senate in 1990.
In 2004, Donnelly ran for Indiana's 2nd congressional district. He won the Democratic nomination unopposed. Incumbent Republican Chris Chocola was helped by several fundraising visits from President George W. Bush, and was able to outspend Donnelly by a two to one margin, $1.4 million to $700,000. Donnelly lost the election, 54%–45%. Due to his relatively late entrance into the contest, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) did not offer much support to Donnelly's 2004 campaign. This would change in 2006, when the race was identified by the DCCC as a "Red-to-Blue" contest and extra funds were sent from out of the district in an effort to win back control of the House of Representatives.

=== Elections ===
2006

On May 2, 2006, Donnelly defeated Steve Francis for the Democratic nomination, setting up a rematch against Chris Chocola. Because Chocola was a strong supporter of George W. Bush, the race was expected to be more competitive than in 2004 in light of Bush's waning popularity. The website Moveon.org identified Donnelly as a top contender to defeat a Republican incumbent in the house, and began running its "Red-Handed" ads against Chocola early in the campaign. Chocola still maintained a significant money advantage over Donnelly, but in 2006, Donnelly had enough to maintain a competitive advertising presence throughout the campaign. The campaign was heated, with the DCCC sponsoring ads attacking Chocola as being beholden to moneyed interests in the insurance, pharmaceutical, and energy industries. Chocola returned fire by attacking Donnelly over a late tax filing and by attempting to link him to liberal House leader Nancy Pelosi.
On November 7, 2006, Donnelly defeated Chocola 54%-46%, a difference of 15,145 votes. The key difference between the 2006 and 2004 elections for Donnelly lay in the results within St. Joseph County, the location of South Bend and by far the largest county in the district. Donnelly won that county with 58% of vote, generating a 14,000-vote margin.
2008

Donnelly ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. In the general election, he won re-election to a second term with 67% of the vote.
2010

Donnelly ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. In the general election, he was challenged by Republican nominee State Representative Jackie Walorski. Despite the Republican wave in the 2010 midterm elections, Donnelly won re-election to a third term, defeating Walorski 48%-46%.


=== Tenure ===
Donnelly was named to the House Financial Services Committee for the 110th Congress.
In the House, Donnelly was a member of Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate Democrats. In March 2007, he was recognized as "Blue Dog of the Week" for his work on helping small businesses. He broke with the Democratic leadership on several budgetary issues, including the 2008 fiscal budget proposal. In June 2007, he was ranked as one of the ten most independent Democrats by a Congressional Quarterly report.

=== 2012 election ===

On May 8, 2012 Donnelly ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. He faced Tea Party favorite, Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, who defeated 6 term incumbent Richard Lugar in the Republican primary, and Libertarian nominee Andy Horning.
During the election, Donnelly framed Mourdock as "the Wall Street candidate," saying that "the difference between me and Mourdock is, I represent the middle class, while he represents the special interests." Donnelly said he would bring "Hoosier common sense" to the Senate while Mourdock would only "contribute to partisan gridlock".
Donnelly's Senate campaign also focused on closing tax loopholes for corporations, cutting taxes on small businesses, investing in American energy production, and cutting spending to balance the national budget. Donnelly was endorsed by every major newspaper in Indiana, and the Louisville Courier Journal, whose readership extends into southern Indiana.
During the campaign Mourdock became embroiled in a controversy after stating that pregnancy from rape is "something that God intended." His remarks were made during a debate on October 23, 2012 while explaining his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape.
On November 6, 2012 Donnelly defeated Mourdock 50%-44%.


=== Tenure ===
On January 3, 2013, Donnelly was sworn into the United State Senate in the 113th Congress by Vice President Joe Biden. Donnelly is first Democrat to hold this seat since Vance Hartke was defeated by Richard Lugar in 1977. Donnelly has said that he will continue the “common-sense Hoosier tradition of Richard Lugar and Evan Bayh.” Matt Tully praised him for his willingness to reach across the aisle. Donnelly has also received praise from his predecessor Richard Lugar for his bipartisan efforts in the Senate. The Lugar Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that was founded by Senator Lugar in 2013, released a Bipartisan Index in cooperation with Georgetown University, ranking Donnelly as the #2 most bipartisan member of the 114th Congress.

Donnelly is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat. While he supports progressive taxation and organized labor, he opposed abortion and same sex marriage during the campaign. On April 5, 2013, Sen. Donnelly endorsed same sex marriage on his Facebook page.


=== Economic policy ===
Taxes
In 2007, Donnelly cosponsored the SAFE Commission Act, calling for a commission to develop legislation designed to reform tax policy and entitlement benefit programs. He also supported attempts in the House to patch the Alternative Minimum Tax, and co-sponsored H.R. 976, The Small Business Tax Relief, Act.
In February 2009, Donnelly voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, stating that it would increase the US's economic competitiveness.
Donnelly voted against the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 (a two-month extension of an expiring provision from the American Recovery Act, forestalling an increase in the payroll tax from 4.2% to 6.2%); he voted for the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (a one-year extension of the same provision). In 2012 Donnelly also voted for H.R. 9, the Small Business Tax Cut Act, which would allow businesses with fewer than 500 employees to receive a tax deduction equal to 20% of their domestic business income.
Donnelly was one of 276 members of Congress who voted for the Tax Relief and Unemployment Insurance Act of 2010, extending the 2001 and 2003 Bush-era tax cuts and a 13-month extension of unemployment benefits. In an interview, Donnelly said that he favors making the tax cuts permanent for middle-class Americans and temporarily extending the cuts for families making at least $250,000. During a speech at the 2012 Indiana Democratic Convention, Donnelly said that he would support a temporary one-year extension of all Bush-era tax cuts, declaring "Given our continued economic challenges, now is the time to keep tax rates low, the last thing our economy can afford is more uncertainty. We need to create jobs, we need to help the middle class and support small businesses, and we need to avoid partisan bickering and delay."
Wall Street regulation
During his second term, Donnelly voted for the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Donnelly helped write three amendements to the final bill; Amendment 1; Helps provide adequate tools to a new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission division that regulates credit rating agencies. Amendment 2; Prevents the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) from being used in the future to purchase equity shares of troubled banks as a rescue attempt, and ensuring that the FDIC is used only to protect customers' savings. Amendment 3; Prohibits the Consumer Financial Protection Agency to act on manufactured housing retailers.
In a March 2012 letter Donnelly signed with Democratic members of the House and Senate, he urged Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler to curb oil speculation in the commodity market through new provisions in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Which, according to a publication from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, oil speculators dominate 80% of the energy futures market and adds $.56 per gallon of gas. In the letter to the Chairman, it read: "We have a responsibility to ensure that the price of gas is no longer allowed to be driven up by the same Wall Street speculators who caused the devastating recession that working families are now experiencing. The CFTC must do what the law mandates and end excessive oil speculation."
In July 2012 Donnelly voted in favor of H.R. 459, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, sponsored by Texas Congressman Ron Paul. The bill requires a full audit of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and Federal reserve banks by the Comptroller General. H.R. 459 is now pending before the Senate.
Labor issues
Donnelly has supported increases in the minimum wage and protection of collective bargaining. In Donnelly's first term he co-sponsored H.R. 2: The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. The act allows Congress to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25, and cuts taxes on small businesses by $12 Billion. After The Fair Minimum Wage Act was signed, Donnelly said in a statement that, “A decent wage is essential for a working family to get by in America. This is not only good social and economic policy, it's just plain fair.” Donnelly voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The law was based after the Supreme Court case Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., when the court decided employers cannot be sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 over gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer 180 days ago or more, The Fair Pay Act amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allowing women to file a lawsuit against their employer if they are paid less than men for doing the same work.


=== Veterans ===

Serving on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Donnelly supported the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Appropriations bill, increasing VA funding by $4 Billion, it was the largest funding increase for the in U.S. history. Since taking office, he has worked to improve the conditions at Walter Reed Hospital by supporting H.R.1538, The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act.
He has worked across the aisle with Congressman Fred Upton (R-MI) to introduce H.R. 1490, The Fairness in Veterans Disability Benefits Act, which reduces waiting time for veterans deserving disability benefits. Donnelly has introduced legislation to create a rural advisory board for veterans aiming to improve private-care options for veterans struck with traumatic brain injury.
Donnelly joined Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) in offering an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 that would enhance the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The amendment would protect service members and their families from improper foreclosures, evictions, and other negative financial consequences of military service. He has also worked to open outpatient clinics in South Bend, Indiana and Elkhart, Indiana.


=== Health care ===
Health care reform
In March 2010, Donnelly voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act). Donnelly has said that it is fully funded.
On September 27, 2013, Donnelly voted to restore funding for the Affordable Care Act as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days, and which also omitted House-passed language prioritizing debt payments if Congress fails to increase the nation’s borrowing limits.
Donnelly has voted to requiring insurance companies to expand coverage, and to cover children on their parents' health insurance plan until they're 26. He has also voted to prohibit health insurance companies from Denying coverage to patients with Pre-existing conditions, charging women more than men on health insurance premiums, and establishing an annual and lifetime cap on insurance payments to individuals. Donnelly has also voted to expand Medicare and Medicaid coverage and eligibility. Donnelly has supported the Hyde Amendment of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits federal funding from being used on abortions other than in cases of incest and rape.
Donnelly has said that the Affordable Care Act can be improved. He has proposed changing the act's definition of full-time work from 30 hours a week to 40. Donnelly has also advocated repealing the medical device excise tax (a 2.3% tax on the sale of certain medical devices by the manufacturer, producer or importer of the device). In 2012 Donnelly cosponsored The Protect Medical Innovation Act, which would repeal the tax. When asked about the tax, Donnelly said that, “We fought very hard to keep the medical-device tax out of the bill, and the pledge was we will continue to fight very hard to have it removed." On September 30, 2013, Donnelly voted to remove a provision which would repeal the medical device tax from a government funding bill in opposition to the provision being used as a condition in keeping the government open.
Children's Health Insurance Program
In 2007 Donnelly was a cosponsor of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIP). Appropriating over $60 billion over 5 years by matching federal funds to states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because the Congress has chosen to send me a bill that moves our health care system in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with raising taxes on cigarettes, a new provision was added to raise taxes on other tobacco products.
Prescription drug coverage
Donnelly, along with 197 members of the House, was a cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. Requiring federal officials to negotiate with prescription drug companies for lower prices for seniors covered by Medicare Part D, repealing the original text of Medicare Part D, banning the government to negotiate with prescription drug companies. Donnelly has voted against the Prescription Drug Imports Act, allowing imports of Prescription Drugs from FDA inspected plants in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and European countries.

Libya
In 2011 Donnelly voted to allow Department of Defense funds to be used for military actions in support of the NATO Intervention in Libya. Donnelly also voted in support of the failed resolution to authorize the President to continue the limited use of U.S. Forces in Libya. The resolution stated that Congress does not support deploying, establishing, or maintaining the presence of units and members of U.S. Armed Forces on the ground in Libya unless the purpose of the presence is limited to the defense of U.S. government officials or NATO member forces from imminent danger.
Iraq
Donnelly voted against the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. In addition, in July 2007, Donnelly joined 221 other House members in voting for HR 2956, the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. This legislation contained a deadline for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.
Afghanistan
In 2011 Donnelly aligned himself with Republicans and 7 other members of the Blue Dog coalition in a 204-215 house vote against an accelerated withdrawal from the war in Afghanistan. Donnelly reaffirmed opposition to an accelerated withdrawal from Afghanistan in voting against the Lee amendment, proposed in H.R. 4310, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. The Lee amendment, if passed, would have prohibited the military spending any money in Afghanistan except for non-combat humanitarian activities, and on activities leading to the withdrawal of American military forces from the country.


=== National security ===
Donnelly is a staunch supporter of Defense spending and has a consistent record of voting with conservatives in spending increases in the Department of Defense and Homeland Security. In 2011 Donnelly voted against H.R. 2219 which would have cut the U.S. military budget by $8.5 billion, stipulating that no cuts were to be taken from pay or benefit programs supporting members and veterans of the armed forces. These cuts would have reduced the emphasis of the U.S. budget on weapons programs. Donnelly also voted against the failed Polis amendment, cutting $640 Million in a 2% across-the-board reduction in spending from the 2012 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. Donnelly voted in favor of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. Civil Liberty advocates have criticized Donnelly for voting for Section 1021, expanding authority to the President to detain suspected al-Qaeda, Taliban, or associated forces (including U.S. citizens) without a trial. Donnelly has voted in support of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act, and requiring FISA warrants for wiretaps in the U.S., but not abroad.


=== Immigration ===
Donnelly voted against the DREAM Act on December 8, 2010. The interest groups English First, Federation for American Immigration Reform, and Americans for a Better Immigration have all been supporters of Donnelly's work, while the National Latino Congreso has adamantly criticized his efforts.


=== Gun ownership ===
Donnelly helped promote a project that would get rid of gun registration and the trigger lock law in Washington, DC. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has disapproved of Donnelly's views and actions since 1998, based on his gun control voting records. Donnelly was one of seventeen Democrats in the U.S. House to vote with the Republican majority for the criminal Contempt of Congress measure against United States Attorney General Eric Holder in the aftermath of Operation Fast and Furious. More recently, Donnelly has expressed support for background checks for all gun purchases. On April 17, 2013, Donnelly joined three other Senate Democrats in voting against the proposed ban on assault weapons [7].


=== Abortion ===
Donnelly is morally opposed to abortion and is trying to make adoption more accessible to families. On the issue of abortion Donnelly said “As a pro-life congressman, I am committed to protecting life at all stages.” In 2011, he co-sponsored HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. The bill contained an exception for "forcible rape," which opponents criticized as potentially excluding drug-facilitated rape, date rape, and other forms of rape. The bill also allowed an exception for minors who are victims of incest.
In 2011 Donnelly received a 20% rating from abortion rights political action group NARAL. Before 2011, Donnelly had consistently received a 0% rating every year from NARAL during his time in the House. Donnelly has received high scores from the pro-life group National Right to Life Committee, never receiving a rating lower than 70%. In August 2015, Donnelly was one of only two Democratic senators who voted to defund Planned Parenthood, the other senator being Joe Manchin of West Virginia.


=== LGBT issues ===
Donnelly has an overall mixed voting record on LGBT rights, receiving a rating of 30% from the Human Rights Campaign in 2010.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Support American Exceptionalism **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: The United Nations has too much power; the US should withdraw, or restrict their actions. The same applies to other international institutions. 
  * **Support** means you believe: United States military forces should never serve under other countries' commands; but multinational forces are acceptable under U.S. command. In general, the U.S. should consider her own national interests first, and then act with other nations in accordance with those interests. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: We can best advance U.S. interests by building alliances and working with other countries on mutual interests. Multilateralism is more effective than unilateralism. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: The United States is just one country among hundreds; we are an important country but the opinions of others count too. We should not throw our weight around, but should use "soft power" and seek other non-military solutions. 

This question is looking for your views on the United States' relations with
the rest of the world. However you answer the above question would be similar
to your response to these statements:

  * Maintain US sovereignty from UN. 
  * Reject refugees from our enemies in the Global War on Terror. 
  * America: Love it or leave it. 
  * US out of the UN; UN out of the US. 
  * America is not subject to the rulings of the International Court of Justice. 
  * America is not in decline; but the "declinists" may make it so. 
  * America has a responsibility as the world's policeman. 
  * Isolationism is better than internationalism. 
  * Cease Foreign Aid to Russia, India, China, and third-world countries. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of unilateralism: America's national interests should always be our priority. 
  * **Support** means you believe in promoting national interests for **practical** reasons, focusing on specific national security interests, and supporting reliable allies. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe in multinational cooperation for **practical** reasons, as a means of achieving America's national interests abroad in conjunction with allies. America's long-term interests are best served by improving international organizations so we can deal with the future geopolitical reality of several equal powers. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of multilateralism: The U.S. should work with other countries because it's the right thing to do. You believe that "National interests" are just a pretext for enforcing "might makes right." 

**    
****BACKGROUND**

**New Foreign Policy Topics for 2014**

These topics arose during the 2013-2014 debates as new topics; we also update
the older topics below from the 2012 primaries...

  * **_American Exceptionalism**_: refers to America having a unique status in the world today. The interest in American exceptionalism counters Obama's rejection of the concept, when Obama said, "Sure, I believe in American exceptionalism in the same way the British believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism." Republicans generally interpret that as meaning, "No, I don't believe in your version of American exceptionalism at all." 

  * **_Islamic State**_: President Obama's foreign policy has focused heavily in 2013-14 on getting other countries to participate in U.S. sanctions (and potential military action) against ISIL (also known as ISIS; the "L" is for "Levant", a wider region than just the "S" for "Syria"). After a politically-unpopular attempt to engage U.S. forces in Syria in 2013, Pres. Obama began doing so in 2014 in both Syria and Iraq (more details in "War and Peace" section). 
**Previous election cycle's Policy Topics (2012)**

These topics arose during the 2011-2012 Republican primary debates as new
topics:

  * **_Helms-Burton**_: refers to the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms (R, NC) and Rep. Dan Burton (R, IN). The law extended the embargo against Cuba, initiated by Pres. Eisenhower in 1960 and strengthened by Pres. Kennedy in 1962. The embargo expresses US opposition to Fidel Castro's communist policies in Cuba. Fidel Castro retired in 2008; the Communist Party still rules via Fidel's brother Raul Castro. Pres. Obama has promised to relax the embargo but as of 2012, only the travel ban was slightly loosened. 

  * **_Cuba Travel Blockade**_: The US government has forbidden US citizens from traveling to Cuba since the 1960s. Try booking a trip from Mexico City to Havana on travelocity.com (or any travel website) and it says, "Due to a U.S. government travel restriction we are unable to book this reservation." You can, however, purchase that same ticket while in Mexico City, or anywhere else in the world. The bill below attempts to undo this long-standing situation. 
**Arab Spring**

  * The term **_Arab Spring**_ refers to a series of revolutions in Arab countries, which toppled (or threatened to topple) dictators or kings. 

  * **_Immolation**_: The first revolution began in Tunisia on Dec. 17, 2010: a fruit vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, tried to stop a policewoman from stealing his fruit. The woman and some other officers then hit the vendor with a baton. After being told at city hall that he could not register a complaint about the incident, Bouazizi immolated himself in an anguished act of protest. 

  * **_Tunisia**_: Bouazizi's suicide sparked widespread protests in Tunisia that toppled the country's dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, and then spread throughout the region. 

  * **_Egypt**_: Protests began in Egypt on Jan. 25; Hosni Mubarak resigned on Feb. 10, 2011. 

  * **_Libya**_: On Jan. 14 2011, protests began in Libya and degenerated into a civil war. On March 19, UN forces (including the US) began a bombing campaign. On Aug. 13, 2011, Moammar Khadafy fled the capital and was subsequently killed. 

  * **_Syria**_: Protests began in Syria on Jan. 26 2011; as part of the region-wide Arab Spring. In 18 months of fighting, over 20,000 civilians have been killed, mostly in the rebel stronghold of Homs, including about 2,000 opposition protesters. Protesters have demanded the end to nearly five decades of Baath Party rule, an end to torture for imprisoned protesters, as well as the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, who inherited his position from his father. The Arab League, the US, and the European Union have condemned Assad's actions, but China and Russia have blocked any sanctions at the UN. 

  * Major protests have occurred in Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, Algeria, and Iraq; numerous other Arab countries have had protests as well. 

  * As of 2014, Arab Spring has converted into a civil war in Syria and Iraq; see the "War and Peace" section for more on that topic. 
**Foreign Aid** The 2012 election has candidates demanding a decrease in foreign aid (or an increase). The actual numbers are listed below; the foreign aid allocation, while controversial, is not economically large: it represents 1.5% of federal expenditures ($47.6 billion out of $1.3 trillion in 2009). Total foreign aid is broken down into military and non-military components, since many would not consider military assistance to be foreign aid but rather war spending by proxy.  Billions / year| Economic Assistance| Military Assistance  
---|---|---  
2000| $13.20 | $4.90  
2001| $12.90 | $3.90  
2002| $15.20 | $4.80

**United Nations**

  * The UN was founded in 1945 with 51 member countries. Its membership has since grown to 189 member countries, with representation from about 90% of the world's countries. 
  * UN Members are sovereign countries. The UN is not a world government, and it does not make laws. It does, however, provide the means to help resolve international conflict and formulate policies on matters affecting every country.  Some of the UN's major organs are: 
    * **The General Assembly:** All UN Member States are represented in the General Assembly - a kind of parliament of nations which meets to consider the world's most pressing problems. Each Member State has one vote. 
    * **The Security Council:** The organ with primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. There are 15 Council members. Five of these - China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States - are permanent members. The other 10 are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. Member States have discussed making changes in Council membership to reflect today's political and economic realities. 
    * **UN peacekeeping operations** are established by the Security Council. There's an ongoing UN presence in Kashmir since 1949; in Cyprus since 1964, and in Kosovo since 1999, for a few examples. The US commits troops to some of these peacekeeping efforts. 
    * **The Economic and Social Council:** Under the authority of the General Assembly, its organs include the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and the UN Children's Fund. 
    * **The International Court of Justice:** The "World Court" is the main judicial organ of the UN. Consisting of 15 judges elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council, the Court decides disputes between countries. Participation by States in a proceeding is voluntary, but if a State agrees to participate, it is obligated to comply with the Court's decision. 
    * **The International Monetary Fund:** The IMF, the World Bank, and other specialized agencies are linked to the UN through cooperative international agreements. 
    * **The UN System:** In addition to financial organizations, other specialized agencies include: the World Health Organization, the Universal Postal Union, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and other treaty-based organizations for international cooperation and commerce. 
  * The US failed to pay its UN dues, until the total reached almost $1 billion in 2000. In May 2001, the House voted 252-165 to withhold $244 million in back dues the US had agreed to pay, until the UN restored the US seat on the UN Human Rights Commission. 
  * Despite the failure to pay dues, the US contributed a total of more than $1.4 billion dollars to the UN system in other assessments, and spent an additional $8.7 billion from the US military budget to support various UN resolutions and peacekeeping operations around the world. 
  * The UN budget (1999) is about $1.3 billion per year for the UN itself and about $10 billion for the UN system (excluding the separate budgets for the IMF and World Bank).  
**Russia**

  * Russia continues to suffer from 50% annual inflation and a recession exacerbated by the Asian economic crisis. The IMF is planning to shore up Russia with a $4.5 billion loan. 
  * US-Russian relations were strained by the Kosovo conflict (Russia has historically supported the Serbs); the expansion of NATO (we added 3 former Soviet satellites over Russian objections in 1997); the war in Chechnya (a Russian province suffering from a Muslim uprising and independence movement); and uncertainty over President Yeltsin's political stability. 
  * Vladimir Putin won election as President of Russia in early 2000. President George W. Bush met with Putin shortly after Bush's inauguration in January 2001. 
  * While Chechnya still is a thorn in the side of US-Russian relations, Russia's assistance in the US war in Afghanistan seems likely to foster good relations and additional US economic aid. 
**Israel & Palestine**

  * The hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu lost the election to Ehud Barak in May 1999. Barak had re-opened peace talks with Syria and Lebanon as of July 1999, promising a negotiated peace with both by next year. 
  * A land-for-peace deal was negotiated with Palestine in the Wye River Accords of 1998, but the process was stalled under Netanyahu. The Palestinian Authority under Yassir Arafat currently controls 27% of the land area of West Bank and Gaza; the Wye River Accords would add 13%. The current land area includes 98% of the Palestinian population. 
  * Ariel Sharon, a conservative hard-liner and former military leader, won election as Prime Minister in 2001, in large part because of Israeli frustration at the continuing Intifadeh, or Palestinian uprising. 
  * Israel has occupied Syria's Golan Heights since 1967. Israel has controlled much of South Lebanon since the early 1980s, with Syria controlling much of the rest of Lebanon. Negotiations with Syria will focus on returning Golan to Syria and returning Lebanon to independence. 
  * **_Does Palestine Exist?**_ (a hot topic in the 2012 GOP primaries): Britain controlled both Israel and Palestine as a colony known as "The British Mandate in Palestine" prior to 1948. On May 14, 1948, the United Nations (with US support, but without Arab support) declared the region partitioned into two states, Israel and Palestine. Neighboring Arab countries immediately invaded; Israel survived the ensuing war but Palestine did not. Egypt, Syria, and Jordan occupied areas which the UN had declared as parts of Palestine. Israel also occupied some of those areas in 1948, and all of those areas in 1967, but Israel agrees that eventually there should be two states. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum claimed during the presidential primaries that "Palestine" does not exist; they mean that it was only an independent legal nation for a very brief period in 1948. But the "Palestinian" identity did exist prior to 1948, and has become the self-identification of Arabs living within the current Israeli borders. 
**Iraq**

  * Since the Gulf War in 1991, the US has launched 4 major military strikes against Iraq, most recently Operation Desert Fox in December 1998. 
  * The US and UN continue to actively enforce a containment policy against Saddam Hussein; our primary tools are the 'no-fly zones' and an economic embargo. 
  * During the US War on Terror, Saddam has been regularly accused of state-sponsored terrorism and of building bioterrorism weapons, but has laid low during the prosecution of the war. 
  * The Iraq War formally ended on Dec. 15, 2011. Approximately 5,000 "security contractors" will remain to guard the US Embassy in Baghdad, plus several thousand more "general support contractors." Another 9,000 US troops are just over the border in Kuwait. 
**North Korea**

  * **_North Korean Nukes**_: Pakistan and their nemesis India both successfully tested nuclear weapons in 1998. Neither country signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and hence their nuclear test were not subject to international criticism. Iran, in contrast, signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1996 and hence is subject to international criticism for developing nuclear weapons. North Korea never signed the treaty, but was criticized internationally anyway for its first nuclear test in 2006. Pakistan and India have about 100 nuclear warheads each, compared to 8,500 possessed by the United States; 11,000 possessed by Russia; and fewer than 10 possessed by North Korea. 

  * **_North Korea**_: 
  * As many as 2 million have died from starvation since 1995. Drought and famine continue today, and South Korea is concerned that the North will attack if facing imminent political collapse. 
  * Naval clashes threatened open warfare in spring and summer 1999. 
  * In 2000, the regime placed emphasis on expanding foreign trade links, embracing modern technology, and attracting foreign investment, but in no way at the expense of relinquishing central control over key national assets or undergoing market-oriented reforms. 

  * **_North Korean Succession**_: 
  * North Korean President Kim made a trip to Moscow in 2000, his first trip ever out of the country, but spent 10 days traveling in each direction by train because he refused to fly. 
  * Kim Jong-Il died in Dec. 2011, and was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-un. The military may get involved in the succession. 
**Asian Economic Crisis** The economies of the Asia-Pacific region until 1997 seemed to be rushing towards prosperity on par with the US and Europe. But in July 1997, the currencies of Thailand and Indonesia collapsed, followed by recessions throughout East Asia. The 'Asian Miracle' countries were characterized by limited democracy (usually one-party) in open economies (albeit via political insiders). The current situation is: 
* **_Japan:**_ In slump since 1990 and in recession since June 1998; Japan outlined an Emergency Economic Package in Nov. 1998. 
* **_Indonesia:**_ President Suharto resigned after 1998 riots in which 1,200 were killed; elections promised for 1999. 
* **_East Timor:**_ Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 shortly after Portugal granted it independence. This island of 800,000 people (to Indonesia's 200 million) voted 80% for independence in August 1999. In September, Pres. Habibie invited in an Australian-led, UN-sponsored force of 7,000, including US support groups but no troops, to stop a massacre by the Indonesian army. 
* **_China:**_ Holding the line on devaluing its currency is credited with stopping total Asian economic collapse. China's economy has been growing by 8-10% annually in recent years, by far the world's fastest growth. They maintain a partially open economy with a Communist government. 
* **_Asian Tigers:**_ Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan all suffered minor recessions and are currently recovering. 
* **_ASEAN:**_ Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Thailand were economically weaker than the more developed 'Tigers,' and suffered accordingly. Nevertheless, ASEAN admitted 4 new members (Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos), which may open and democratize those countries.
