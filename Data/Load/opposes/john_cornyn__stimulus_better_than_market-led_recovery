John Cornyn III (born February 2, 1952) is the senior United States Senator from Texas, serving since 2002. He is a member of the Republican Party and the current Senate Majority Whip for the 114th Congress. Cornyn previously served as Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 2007 to 2011.
Born in Houston, Cornyn is a graduate from Trinity University and St. Mary's University School of Law, receiving his LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law. Cornyn was a Judge on Texas' 37th District Court from 1985 to 1991, until he was elected an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court, where he served 1991 to 1997. In 1998, Cornyn was elected Attorney General of Texas, serving one term until winning a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2002. He was re-elected to a second term in 2008 and to a third term in 2014.


== Early life, education, and legal career ==
Cornyn was born in Houston, the son of Atholene Gale Cornyn (née Danley) and John Cornyn II, a colonel in the U.S. Air Force. He attended the American School in Japan while growing up when his family moved to Tokyo. He graduated from Trinity University in 1973, where he majored in journalism and was a member of Chi Delta Tau. He earned a J.D. from St. Mary's University School of Law in 1977 and an LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1995. He was named the St. Mary's Distinguished Law School Graduate in 1994 and a Trinity University Distinguished Alumnus in 2001.
He served in San Antonio for six years as a district judge before being elected as a Republican in 1990 to the Texas Supreme Court, on which he served for seven years.

=== 1998 election ===
In 1998 Cornyn decided to run to become Texas Attorney General. In the March primary, Barry Williamson, Railroad Commissioner, placed first with 38% of the vote but failed to get the 50% threshold necessary to win the Republican nomination. Cornyn, then a state Supreme Court Justice, got second place with 32%. In the April run-off election, Cornyn defeated Williamson 58% to 42%. In the general election, Cornyn defeated Jim Mattox, former attorney general (1983–1991) and U.S. Congressman, with 54% of the vote. Cornyn became only the second Republican to hold the position.


=== Accomplishments ===

He created the Texas Internet Bureau to investigate illegal internet practices. He fought against government waste and corruption with his investigation of fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims.
However, Cornyn was criticized for failing to investigate in a timely manner the notorious false drug convictions of numerous African-Americans in Tulia, Texas. An Austin Chronicle article on September 6, 2002, noted, "After months of criticism from civil rights groups and state and national media, state attorney general and U.S. Senate candidate John Cornyn announced that his office will finally investigate the notorious 1999 drug bust in the Panhandle town of Tulia. In most cases, the testimony of a single narcotics agent led to the arrests of 46 people—43 of whom were black. The accused represented 16% of the town's black population; 14 still languish in prisons scattered around Texas".
In 2005 Cornyn's name was mentioned among possibilities to replace Supreme Court justices Sandra Day O'Connor or William Rehnquist.


== United States Senate ==


=== Elections ===
2002

In the 2002 U.S. Senate Primary in Texas, Cornyn was the candidate promoted and supported by the Texas Republican Party. He easily defeated the five other candidates in the Republican Primary while disdaining the opportunity to debate the other candidates. Cornyn defeated his closest Republican challenger, Bruce Rusty Lang, a self-financed Dallas-based international physician, in the Republican Primary election by a ten to one electoral margin. In the 2002 General election, Cornyn defeated Democrat Ron Kirk in a campaign that cost each candidate over $18 million. Cornyn's predecessor, Phil Gramm, resigned early, effective November 30, 2002, so that Senator-Elect Cornyn could take office early, and move into Gramm's office suite in order to begin organizing his staff. Cornyn did not, however, gain seniority, owing to a 1980 Rules Committee policy that no longer gave seniority to senators who entered Congress early for the purpose of gaining advantageous office space.
2008

Texas has not elected a Democrat in a statewide election since 1994, and according to Rasmussen polling, in October 2008 Cornyn had an approval rating of 50%. Texas House of Representatives member/Afghanistan War veteran Rick Noriega secured his place as Cornyn's Democratic challenger in the March 4 primary, beating out opponents Gene Kelly, Ray McMurrey, and Rhett Smith. The same Rasmussen poll showed Cornyn leading Noriega 47% to 43%, suggesting that this race might have proved to be unexpectedly competitive. However, most polls showed a much wider margin. Christian activist Larry Kilgore of Mansfield, was a Republican challenger for the March 2008 primary election, but Cornyn easily won the Republican Primary.
Yvonne Adams Schick was the Libertarian Party's nominee. In addition, the Green Party of Texas sought ballot access for its candidate David B. Collins.
2014

Cornyn succeeded in his reelection in 2014. He is now Senate Majority Whip. He won the Republican primary with 59% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
In 2004 Cornyn co-founded and became the co-chairman of the U.S. Senate India Caucus. Cornyn was selected by his colleagues in December 2006 to be a member of the five-person Republican Senate leadership team as Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.
Cornyn has received various awards and recognitions, including the 2005 Border Texan of the Year Award; the National Child Support Enforcement Association's Children's Champion Award; the American Farm Bureau Federation's Friend of Farm Bureau Award; the Texas Association of Business's (TAB) Fighter for Free Enterprise Award; the National Federation of Independent Business's (NFIB) Guardian of Small Business Award; the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders's (CONLAMIC) Latino Leadership Award; and the Texas Association of Mexican American Chambers of Commerce's (TAMACC) International Leadership Legislative Award; among others.
In 2005 Cornyn gained notice by connecting the Supreme Court's reluctance to hear arguments for sustaining Terri Schiavo's life with the recent murders of Judge Joan Lefkow's husband and mother as well as the courtroom murder of Judge Rowland Barnes. Cornyn said: "I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and building up to the point where some people engage in violence". His statement and a similar one by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay were widely denounced, including by the New York Times. Cornyn later said that he regretted the statement.
In 2005 the Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Cornyn and Senator Patrick Leahy with its first ever Bi-Partisan Leadership Award in honor of their cooperation on issues of government oversight and transparency, including their co-sponsorship of the OPEN Government Act of 2005, which prevented burying exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act in legislation.
Cornyn has been described by Jim Jubak of MSN Money as one of "Big Oil's ten favorite members of Congress", as he has received more money from the oil and gas industry than all but six other members of Congress.
On the day of Obama's inauguration, it was reported that Cornyn would prevent Hillary Rodham Clinton from being confirmed as secretary of state by a unanimous floor vote that day. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's spokesman reported to the Associated Press that a roll call vote would be held instead on the following day, January 21, 2009, for the Clinton confirmation and that it was expected Clinton would "receive overwhelming bipartisan support". The vote was 94–2 in her favor, with only Senators Jim DeMint (R-SC) and David Vitter (R-LA) voting in opposition.
As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Cornyn was a strong supporter of Norm Coleman's various court challenges to the election certification. Cornyn advocated for Coleman to bring the case before the federal court, and had said the trial and appeals could take years to complete. Cornyn had threatened that Republicans would wage a "World War III" if the Senate Democrats had attempted to seat Democratic candidate Al Franken before the appeals were complete. Coleman conceded after the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in favor of Democratic candidate Al Franken. On November 14, 2012, Cornyn was elected Senate minority whip by his peers.
In February 2013, Cornyn became one of the sponsors of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.

== Political positions ==
Cornyn was ranked by National Journal as the fourteenth-most conservative United States Senator in their 2013 rankings. He was considered by The Dallas Morning News to be a reliable ally of former President George W. Bush on most issues.


=== Civil rights and law enforcement ===
In the 2004 debate surrounding the Federal Marriage Amendment, Cornyn released an advance copy of a speech he was to give at the Heritage Foundation. In the speech, he wrote, "It does not affect your daily life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle. But that does not mean it is right... Now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife". According to his office, he removed the reference to the box turtle in the actual speech, but the Washington Post ran the quote, as did The Daily Show.
Cornyn sponsored a bill that would allow law enforcement to force anyone arrested or detained by federal authorities to provide samples of their DNA, which would be recorded in a central database. He voted to recommend a constitutional ban on flag desecration and for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. He also voted for the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act and extending its wiretap provision.


=== Defense and homeland security ===
Cornyn was one of only 22 Senators to vote against the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 that expands the educational benefits for soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, he co-sponsored SB 2938, which gives benefits that are dependent on length of service.
In August 2012, following news reports that a Russian Akula-class nuclear-powered submarine operated in the Gulf of Mexico purportedly undetected for over a month, Cornyn demanded details of this deployment from Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, the Chief of Naval Operations.
In 2013 Cornyn said that, despite the sequester, the Pentagon would actually see its budget increase.


=== Social policy ===
He voted to ban partial-birth abortions except in cases where the mother's life was in danger, and for a criminal penalty for harming a fetus while committing another crime. He also voted in favor of notifying parents of minors who get out-of-state abortions. He voted against expanding research to more embryonic stem cell lines. He voted to prevent contributions to organizations that provide abortion as a component of family planning, and to prevent funding of organizations that support coercive abortion.
Cornyn voted to confirm Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States. In September 2005, during the Supreme Court hearings for Roberts, Cornyn's staff passed out bingo cards to reporters. He asked them to stamp their card every time a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee used terms such as "far right" or "extremist".
On July 24, 2009, Cornyn announced his intention to vote against President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor, citing his opinion that she might rule "from a liberal, activist perspective".


=== Fiscal policy ===
Cornyn voted to permanently repeal the estate tax and for raising the estate tax exemption to $5 million. He voted in favor of $350 billion in tax cuts over 11 years and supports making the George W. Bush tax cuts permanent. However, he stands opposed to extending the 2011 payroll tax holiday.
Cornyn is a cosponsor of the Fair Tax Act of 2007. John Cornyn also voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 but against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009.
In 2005 Cornyn voted against including oil and gas smokestacks in mercury regulations. He voted against factoring global warming into federal project planning, and against banning drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He also voted against removing oil and gas exploration subsidies. During his tenure in the Senate, Cornyn has scored 0% on the League of Conservation Voters' environmental scorecard, a system of ranking politicians according to their voting record on environmental legislation.
Cornyn opposed President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Cornyn stated that Senator Cruz's efforts to defund Obamacare were "unachievable". He also stated: "The shutdown did not help our cause. What did help our cause was the president’s implementation of Obamacare, which has overwhelmed everything else. I don’t hear anyone thinking that another government shutdown is the way to achieve our goals."
Cornyn joined other Republican leaders to block fellow Texas Senator Ted Cruz's procedural move to reject an increase in the debt ceiling.
Cornyn voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in 2008 also known as the Wall Street bailout, and later voted to end the program.


=== Gun rights ===
In April 2013, Senator Cornyn was one of 46 senators to vote against the passing of a bill which would have expanded background checks for all buyers. Cornyn voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop the passage of the bill.
In January 2014, Senator Cornyn introduced the "Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act". The bill would provide interstate reciprocity for persons with concealed weapons permits. Cornyn described the bill as "It’s like a driver’s license. It doesn’t trump state laws. Say you have a carry permit in Texas; then you use it in another state that has a concealed-carry law." He is rated "A" by the National Rifle Association.


=== Victims rights ===
Senator John Cornyn has long been opposed to anyone profiting from memorabilia tied to convicted murderers, and had made three attempts thus far to pass acts against this. He introduced his first "Stop the Sale of Murderabilia to Protect the Dignity of Crime Victims Act" in 2007, which died in committee. He then revived it three years later with cosponsor Amy Klobuchar. The 2010 version of the "Murderabilia" bill met the same fate as the first.
In 2013, inspired by a Nidal Hasan letter put up for sale by artist Kelly Hutchison, Conryn decided to continue working on his bill. The listing claimed that all proceeds would be donated to charity, and the letter was reported to have sold anywhere from $2000 USD to $500,000 USD by various news sources.


== Electoral history ==


== Personal life ==
Cornyn and his wife, the former Sandy Hansen, have two daughters.
Cornyn gained national attention when he released a video referring to himself as "Big Bad John." The video was featured on comedy shows such as The Colbert Report and The Daily Show.
In August 2014, Cornyn was named "Mr. South Texas" for the 118th Washington's Birthday Celebration in Laredo in February 2015. WBCA president Veronica Castillon said that Cornyn "loves Laredo, and it shows through his attention and actions ..."
Cornyn receives payments from 3 separate state and local government pensions in addition to his Senate salary.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Stimulus better than market-led recovery **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe: The federal government should inject as much funding as needed to recuperate from the Great Recession, including direct federal job creation. Nationalization of banks and companies is more appropriate than bailouts. 
  * **Support** means you believe: The federal government should institute incentives for private corporations for more hiring, to recuperate from the Great Recession. Funding to "bail out" private companies should be accompanied by rules for corporate behavior and repayment. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: Cutting taxes and reducing regulation is the means to recuperate from the Great Recession. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: The federal government caused the Great Recession, and keeping out of the economy will end it. 

This question is looking for your views on the government's role in moving the
country out of the Great Recession.   However you answer the above question
would be similar to your response to these statements:

  * Corporate malfeasance caused the [Great Recession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession). 
  * More regulation is the solution to the Great Recession, not the cause of it. 
  * A company that is [too big to fail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail) should be nationalized, or run by the federal government. 
  * Corporate bailouts made some sense, to save jobs, but bank bailouts just rewarded the wrongdoers. 
  * Wall Street bankers of the early 2000s are no different than the [robber barons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_\(industrialist\)) of the early 1900s. 
  * [Occupy Wall Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street) expresses the voice of the people agaisnt the voice of Big Business. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** of federal intervention in the economy. 
  * **Support** means you believe government oversight is needed for **practical** reasons: the Great Recession is a big enough cause, but most others aren't. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe in **practical** reasons for lower taxation and deregulation, to quickly increase hiring. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe in the **principle** of lower taxation and deregulation, regardless of the current situation.

The federal budget is not difficult to understand. Politicians intentionally
muddy the water and thereby make the federal budget difficult to understand,
to gain political advantage for one political goal or another. We will explain
the basics here -- everything else is politics.

  * _**Spending and revenue:**_ The budget has two important halves: spending (where the money goes) and revenue (where the money comes from). The two sides have to equal each other, in order to account for all the money. 

### Where the money goes

  * _**National Debt:**_ The annual budget deficits don't get paid off each year -- they just accumulate year after year, into the National Debt, which is currently over $13 trillion. We pay interest in that debt -- amounting to $901 billion in 2012. 
  * _**Entitlements:**_ The largest budget spending items, totalling $1.6 trillion in 2012, are Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid -- the so-called entitlement programs. The policy options for these programs are discussed in the [Social Security](Social_Security.htm) section. 
  * _**Non-discretionary spending:**_ The federal budget separates mandatory payments from discretionary spending. Entitlements and interest (plus another $583 billion in smaller programs) are deemed non-discretionary while everything else is deemed discretionary. Those terms are political double-talk -- Congress has the discretion to make political decisions on funding mandatory programs just like every other political decision. But because so many people rely on these funds, it is politically difficult to alter them in the short-term, so most discussion applies to the very long-term (with small changes in current policy that have large effect years later). 
  * _**National Defense spending:**_ Funding the Pentagon is by far the largest discretionary item in the budget. The policy options for defense programs are discussed in the [Homeland Security](Homeland_Security.htm) section. 
  * _**Supplemental spending:**_ Congress and the Bush Administration routinely pretended that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan posed unexpected expenses. Therefore they were not funded in the regular budget, but instead by a special Supplemental Spending Bill which is voted on separately, outside of the budget, each year. Pres. Obama in 2010 changed to using an on-budget Overseas Contingency Operations instead of off-budget war supplemental bills. 
  * _**Discretionary spending:**_ All other non-defense expenditures total up to 14% of the budget. This budget section is where most Congressional debate focuses, even though the other budget sections are far larger. Republicans endlessly lambast NEA spending ($0.1 billion for the National Endowment for the Arts in 2008) and Democrats equally lambast spending on the Special Prosecutor (about $0.06 billion to produce the report that led to Bill Clinton's impeachment). 
  * If Republicans want to reduce the size of government, or if Democrats want fiscal responsibility, they should focus on the Big Four listed above: defense spending; Social Security; Medicare/Medicaid; and the budget deficit. Everything else is political -- they have a very minor impact on the budget totals. On the other hand, we should keep in mind the enormous scale of the budget: as one analyst said, A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon youre talking real money. 
  * Politicians often call for "freezing all but the non-defense non-entitlement budget" -- a typical politicians' attempt to muddy the water -- defense and entitlements account for the majority of the budget. 
  * Furthermore, Congress has full control over "mandatory" spending (it's only mandated from the previous year; Congress can change it at any time). 
  * Voters should listen for other (very common!) attempts at muddying the water, by looking at what are the actual underlying amounts being discussed. 

### Where the money comes from

  * _**Individual income taxes:**_ The biggest component of federal revenue is the income tax -- and this is what politicians mostly talk about when discussing policy. The $1.3 trillion in personal income taxes does not include state income taxes, sales tax, or any other local tax. Tax policy is detailed in our [Tax Reform](Tax_Reform.htm) section. 
  * _**Social insurance (FICA):**_ This comes up in the 2012 debates as raising the cap. In theory, each person's individual FICA funds their own retirement, so the tax is "capped" at income of $106,800 in 2012, up from $92,500 in 2008. Income above $106,800 has no FICA tax. In practice, the sum of FICA payments all go into the Social Security Trust Fund, so some politicians say the individual link is meaningless, and therefore FICA is a regressive tax (the wealthy pay less). Raising the cap, or removing it entirely, would raise revenue substantially. Details are discussed in the [Social Security](Social_Security.htm) section. 
  * _**Corporate income taxes:**_ US corporate income taxes are the second-highest in the world, tax-cutter politicians constantly remind us. The sum is still only 1/6th of what individuals pay. Details of all corporate tax policy are discussed in the [Corporations](Corporations.htm) section. 
  * _**Other taxes & duties:**_ While only 6% of federal revenue comes from everything other than those three sources, this smallest section once again includes a lot of the political debate. The "Death Tax" (inheritance tax) is included here; and Mitt Romney was damaged by claiming that raising user fees in this category should not count as tax increases. 
  * _**Budget deficit:**_ Unlike normal budgets, the federal government can print its own money. The deficit amounted to $901 billion in 2012. The form of printing money to cover the deficit varies from year to year; the recent favorite is federal bonds that are sold to foreign governments and other wealthy entities. That leads to political accusations that, for example, the Chinese government is funding our deficit. 

### Budget Buzzwords

  * _**QE3**_ refers to Quantitative Easing of the money supply by the Federal Reserve, the third round of which took place in Sept. 2012. The QE3 program entails purchasing $40 billion monthly in mortgage-backed securities. QE1 and QE2, earlier in the Great Recession, injected $2.3 trillion into the economy, also via the securities market. Critics call the programs printing money which is inherently inflationary. 
  * The _**sequester**_ refers to automatic budget cuts mandated after the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011. The Super committee" failed to come up with a budget replacement plan in late 2011, so the sequestration rules take effect in 2013. Those rules specify across-the-board spending cuts of $1.2 trillion in the period 2013 to 2021. The cuts apply to Medicare and DoD roughly equally; i.e., social spending and defense spending are both cut for political balance. 
  * The _**debt ceiling**_: The 2013 budget includes a deficit of $901 billion (more spending than revenue). The annual budget deficits dont get paid off each yearthey just accumulate year after year, into the National Debt, which is currently over $15 trillion. We pay interest on that debtamounting to $246 billion in 2012. Congress determines the debt ceiling, which is the total amount that the federal government can be in debt. The actual debt must remain lower than the debt ceiling or the government may not borrow more money; currently the ceiling is set at $16.4 trillion. 
  * _**Dodd-Frank**_ refers to Sen. Chris Dodd (D, CT) and Rep. Barney Frank (D, MA), the co-authors of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation was intended to reform the rules of the financial and insurance industry to avoid another "meltdown" like the one in mid-2008 which initiated the Great Recession. 
  * _**Earmarks**_ refers to itemized spending in legislation, i.e., funding targeted toward a particular project in a particular place. The controversy comes about because often the particular place includes the home district of the legislator writing or sponsoring the bill (which is known derisively as "Pork-Barrel Spending"). Earmarks are currently legal and are generally considered ethical; earmark reform focuses on publicizing their existence and perhaps on a future Line Item Veto to remove some. 
  * _**Fannie & Freddie**_ refer to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, Freddie Mac). Fannie and Freddie were "GSEs"--government-sponsored enterprises--half-private, half-federal, until 2008, when they were placed under full federal control. Their role is to assist banks with creating individual mortgages. 
  * _**PAYGO**_ refers to a "pay-as-you-go" policy, where all expenditures in a bill are explicitly paid for, instead of requiring borrowing. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 required all new spending bills to include how the spending would be balanced by revenue enhancements (taxes or fees) or other spending cuts. The PAYGO statute expired in 2002, but some congressional bills still describe offsets for new spending. 
  * _**Simpson-Bowles**_ refers to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and its conclusions released in 2010. It is named after its two chairs, Sen. Alan Simpson (R, WY) and Erskine Bowles (D, NC). The Commission proposed reducing the national debt by a combination of increased revenue (raising taxes, including a 15-cent gas tax); reductions in discretionary spending; Medicare cost controls; raising the Social Security retirement age; and a reduction in entitlements.

### Budget Deficit versus National Debt

A budget deficit means that the amount the government receives in taxes in one
fiscal year is less than the amount that the government has spent. Generally,
the government borrows money from people by issuing bonds to cover the
deficit.

The accumulated borrowing is the National Debt that the government must repay
in the future. The current federal debt stands at over $13 trillion, which is
the equivalent of roughly $40,000 per person. The federal government pays over
$200 billion in annual interest on the national debt.

### Social Security Trust Fund

  * Much debate focuses on how the budget deficit is calculated and how the Social Security Trust Fund is accounted for. 
  * The Trust Fund is off-budget, which means it is not counted in the reporting of the budget. 
  * However, the government reports the budget surplus or deficit from a Unified Budget which _does_ include the Trust Fund. Hence the growth of the Fund offsets the shortfall in the budget. 
  * In 1998, the budget surplus was reported as $40 billion on the unified budget. Discounting the Trust Fund, the budget would have been in deficit by $50 billion. 
  * By 2008, th e budget deficit has returned in full force -- to $246 billion, and after 2008, increased substantially more for stimulus spending to deal with the Great Recession. 

### The Federal Reserve

Ben Bernanke is the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, which is known as
The Fed. (Alan Greenspan was the previous chairman) . The Federal Reserve
chairman is appointed to a 4-year term by the President but then cannot be
removed, to allow The Fed independence in monetary policy.

Bernankes primary responsibility is to set the interest rates that the
government pays on its bonds. Those rates in turn determine bank interest
rates, mortgage lending rates, and other interest rates.

When the Federal Reserve Bank feels that there is to much inflationary
pressure, they are likely to raise interest rates to slow the economy down.
Hence, Bernanke raises interest rates (tightens money) when he sees the
economy as overheating, and lowers interest rates (loosens money) when he sees
deflation threatening.

The longest economic expansion in US history ended in October 2001. During
2001, Alan Greenspan lowered interest an unprecedented 10 times in one year,
to provide monetary stimulus to the lagging economy. President Bush pushed for
fiscal stimulus by sending out $300 tax rebate checks to millions of
taxpayers.

In 2007-2008, to attempt to counter the mortgage crisis leading to a
recession, Ben Bernanke tried the same strategy, lowering interest rates
repeatedly.

### Mortgage Crisis

The Subprime mortgage crisis began with a sharp rise in home foreclosures in
the United States during the fall of 2006 and became a global financial crisis
during 2007 and 2008. The crisis began with the bursting of the housing bubble
in the U.S. and high default rates on "subprime", adjustable rate, and other
mortgage loans made to higher-risk borrowers with lower income or lesser
credit history than "prime" borrowers.

  * The mortgage crisis may lead to a recession because of the large number of people affected, and because the construction sector is a large factor in the economy. Hence politicians are all proposing "stimulus packages" to stave off a recession. Those proposals -- and reactions to Pres. Bush's version of a one-time tax rebate and later economic stimulus measures -- make up the majority of presidential candidates' comments in this topic area. 
  * **Economic Stimulus Act**: In Feb. 2008, Pres. Bush pushed legislation intended to avoid a full financial crisis, by mailing tax rebate checks of several hundred dollars to every taxpayer. The checks arrived at a time when fuel prices reached an all-time high, breaking $4 per gallon of gasoline in the summer of 2008. Discussion of additional economic stimulus (and whether the initial stimulus succeeded) was lost in the more urgent financial crises later in 2008. 
  * **Housing and Economic Recovery Act**: In late July 2008, Congress enacted legislation intended to avoid a full financial crisis, by injecting $300 billion into the mortgage market to restructure subprime mortgage loans. As a result, on Sept. 7, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental mortgage entities, were placed under federal control. 
  * **Fannie and Freddie**: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are "GSEs" -- government-sponsored enterprises -- semi-public corporations designed to assist banks with creating individual mortgages. The names are acronyms for Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, Freddie Mac). "Semi-public" means half-private, half-federal, until 2008, when they were placed under full federal control. Their role is to assist banks with creating individual mortgages. 
  * **Emergency Economic Stabilization Act**: In Oct. 2008, Congress enacted a $700 billion package intended to alleviate severely contracted liquidity in the global credit market (which means banks would not lend each other funds, and hence no credit would be available to consumers for mortgages or credit cards); and to address insolvency threats to investment banks (which means, big banks would go broke, potentially causing a run on other banks as consumers lost confidence).   
  
\- This legislation is commonly referred to as the "financial bailout" in
political discussions, even though the funding is structured as investments
that may yield positive returns (which means, the net cost to taxpayers could
conceivably be much lower than $700 billion, over several years).  
  
\- The essence of the financial bailout is that the Secretary of the Treasury
is empowered to purchase "troubled assets" in the banking and insurance
industry. with the intent of stabilizing and then re-selling those assets when
the crisis is past.  
  
\- The final legislation went through several major revisions in Congress,
including two well-publicized NO votes in the US House, followed by public
speeches from Pres. Bush that changes would follow. Sen. McCain suspended his
presidential campaign to deal with one version of the bailout vote.  
  
\- The popular $700 billion figure is also inaccurate; the final legislation
totalled $850 billion, adding $150 billion in unrelated projects to garner
positive votes from holdout members of Congress.  
  
\- The taxpayer cost of the bailout, if it totals a net cost of $700 billion,
would be $4,635 per working American (based on an estimate of 151 million in
the work force).  
  
\- Rhetoric abounds on both sides of the financial bailout: proponents insist
it was necessary to avoid a full-blown Depression; opponents insist it is a
federal takeover of the banking industry destined to cause hyperinflation.

### Great Recession

  * **Dodd-Frank**: refers to Sen. Chris Dodd (D, CT) and Rep. Barney Frank (D, MA), the co-authors of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation was intended to reform the rules of the financial and insurance industry to avoid another "meltdown" like the one in mid-2008 which initiated the Great Recession. 
  * **Earmarks**: refers to itemized spending in legislation, i.e., funding targeted toward a particular project in a particular place. The controversy comes about because often the particular place includes the home district of the legislator writing or sponsoring the bill (which is known derisively as "Pork-Barrel Spending"). Earmarks are currently legal and are generally considered ethical; earmark reform focuses on publicizing their existence and perhaps on a future Line Item Veto to remove some. 
  * **PAYGO**: refers to a "pay-as-you-go" policy, where all expenditures in a bill are explicitly paid for, instead of requiring borrowing. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 required all new spending bills to include how the spending would be balanced by revenue enhancements (taxes or fees) or other spending cuts. The PAYGO statute expired in 2002, but some congressional bills still describe offsets for new spending. 
  * **Simpson-Bowles**: refers to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and its conclusions released in 2010. It is named after its two chairs, Sen. Alan Simpson (R, WY) and Erskine Bowles (D, NC). The Commission proposed reducing the national debt by a combination of increased revenue (raising taxes, including a 15-cent gas tax); reductions in discretionary spending; Medicare cost controls; raising the Social Security retirement age; and a reduction in entitlements.
