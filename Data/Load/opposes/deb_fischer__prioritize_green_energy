Debra Strobel "Deb" Fischer (born March 1, 1951) is the senior U.S. Senator from the state of Nebraska. Previously, she was a two-term member of the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 43rd District. She defeated former United States Senator Bob Kerrey in the election held on November 6, 2012, and assumed one of Nebraska's two Senate seats in January 2013.
Fischer is a member of the Republican Party.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Fischer was born Debra Strobel in 1951, in Lincoln, Nebraska[1], the daughter of Florence M. (née Bock) and Gerold Carl "Jerry" Strobel[2]. Her father was the State Engineer/Director of the Nebraska Department of Roads under governors Kay Orr and Ben Nelson[3] and her mother was an elementary school teacher with Lincoln Public Schools.
In 1972, she married Bruce Fischer, from Valentine, whom she had met while both attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. She and her husband raised three sons on the Fischer family cattle ranch south of Valentine. In 1988, she returned to the university and completed her B.S. degree in education[4].

=== Elections ===
In 2004, Fischer ran for the Nebraska legislature from the 43rd legislative district. In the nonpartisan primary, she came in second in a field of seven, receiving 2226 votes (25.1%); front-runner Kevin T. Cooksley received 2264 votes (25.5%). In the general election, she defeated Cooksley with 8178 votes to his 8050, for a margin of 50.4%–49.6%.
In 2008, she won re-election unopposed. Nebraska's term-limits law precluded her running for re-election in 2012.


=== Tenure ===
Fischer's district was geographically the largest in the Nebraska Legislature, comprising 12 counties and part of a 13th. During her tenure in the legislature, she did a weekly radio show on seven stations covering her district, and wrote a weekly column printed in several newspapers.
In 2007, she helped to filibuster a bill that created a statewide smoking ban for indoor workplaces and public places.
In 2009, Fischer was one of fourteen co-sponsors of L.B. 675, which required abortion providers to display ultrasound images of the fetus at least one hour prior to the abortions, in a position where the abortion seeker could easily view them. A spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee stated that the Nebraska law was stronger than those of other states, which only required that the client be asked if she wanted to see an ultrasound image. The measure passed by a 40–5 vote, and was signed into law by Governor Dave Heineman.


=== Committee assignments ===
Executive Board and the Revenue Committee
Transportation and Telecommunications Committee (Chair)


== U.S. Senate (2013–Present) ==


=== 2012 election ===


==== Primary ====
In January 2012, after incumbent Democratic Senator Ben Nelson announced his retirement, Fischer officially announced she would run for the U.S. Senate. The Republican primary campaign was expected to shape up as a battle between Attorney General Jon Bruning and State Treasurer Don Stenberg; Fischer and three less well-known candidates were also on the ballot.
During the primary campaign, Fischer was criticized by environmentalists and others because her family's ranch near Valentine grazed cattle on federal land, leasing it for about $110,000 per year less than the market rate on private land. Opponents of federal grazing leases argued that she should relinquish her family's permit if she wants to remain "morally consistent" with her message of less government. Fischer argued that the poor quality of federal lands, plus the restrictions that come with federal leases, make it inappropriate to compare them to private leases.
In the campaign, Fischer was outspent by Bruning, who raised $3.6 million, and Stenberg, who spent $865,000. Fischer's campaign raised only $440,000. However, Bruning and Stenberg spent much of their resources attacking one another; Fischer benefitted from the damage that each did to the other's approval ratings. She was also aided by $725,000 in television ads bought by the Club for Growth attacking Bruning. Shortly before the election, she was endorsed by Nebraska U.S. Representative Jeff Fortenberry and by 2008 Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who recorded robocalls endorsing her; and a super PAC financed by former Omaha businessman Joe Ricketts paid for $250,000 worth of television advertising promoting Fischer and opposing Bruning.
Fischer won the primary election with 40% of the vote. Bruning ranked second with 35%, and Stenberg ranked third with 18%. Fischer took a plurality of votes in 75 of Nebraska's 93 counties. Bruning won 15 counties and Schuyler businessman Pat Flynn received a plurality in his home Colfax County. Fischer and Bruning tied in Kimball and Sioux counties.


==== General election ====
In the general election, Fischer faced Democrat Bob Kerrey, a former Nebraska governor and U.S. senator, who was running for the seat that he had held from 1989 to 2001.
In the course of the campaign, Kerrey's advertising accused Fischer of unprincipled conduct in the matter of a 1995 adverse possession suit, whereunder the Fischers had attempted to obtain title to 104 acres (42 ha) of land adjoining their property. The Kerrey campaign maintained that Fischer, after losing the lawsuit, had used her position in the Legislature to keep the landowners from selling the property to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (NGPC). The episode, declared a Kerrey website, had shown "[n]eighbor suing neighbor; vindictiveness; pettiness; deceit; abuse of power". Fischer maintained that their intent in filing the suit was to obtain a more manageable boundary for their ranch, after repeated attempts to purchase the land had failed; an Omaha World-Herald analysis stated that the Kerrey campaign's statements regarding Fischer's actions in the Legislature failed to mention her support for a compromise measure that would have allowed NGPC to buy the land. A Fischer spokesman accused Kerrey of "reckless disregard for the truth" and "gutter politics" in the matter.
In the general election, Fischer defeated Kerrey 58%–42%. Fischer won mainly by swamping Kerrey in the state's rural areas. She won 88 of Nebraska's 93 counties. Kerrey only won Douglas, Lancaster, Saline, Thurston, and Dakota counties.
Fischer became the third female U.S. Senator in Nebraska's history, and the first since 1954. She was the first elected to a full term: of the earlier woman Senators, Eva Bowring was appointed in 1954 to occupy the seat vacated by the death of Dwight Griswold until a special election could be held to replace him later that year; Hazel Abel won that special election to finish Griswold's term, but did not seek a full term.


=== Positions ===
In Fischer's 2012 campaign materials, she quoted several politicians and editorials describing her as a "true conservative" and a "staunch conservative".
Fischer supports a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution and has signed Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge promising not to raise taxes on individuals and businesses. She has also declared herself opposed to cuts in entitlement programs for Americans over the age of 40.
In her 2012 campaign literature, Fischer stated that she "would vote to fully repeal Obamacare."
Fischer describes herself as "proud to be pro-life", and cites her endorsements from Nebraska Right to Life and from the Susan B. Anthony List.
Fischer's 2012 campaign materials state that she "[s]upports the federal marriage amendment". She opposes same-sex marriage.
According to Fischer's 2012 campaign literature, she has "opposed every attempt effort [sic] by groups seeking to restrict our right to own firearms."
In her 2012 campaign materials, Fischer declared, "The EPA must be reformed and possibly eliminated". She stated that current greenhouse-gas regulations needed to be made less restrictive, and expressed her opposition to a cap-and-trade policy.
In Fischer's 2012 campaign materials, she expressed support for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution limiting Senators to two six-year terms, and U.S. Representatives to three two-year terms. She pledged to "limit herself to two terms in office." She also stated that members of the U.S. Congress should be placed under a lifetime ban from becoming federally registered lobbyists.
Fischer's 2012 campaign website states that she "[o]pposes amnesty and benefits for illegal aliens", that she voted against Nebraska's version of the DREAM Act in its passage in 2006, and that she co-sponsored a bill to repeal the state act in 2010.


=== Tenure ===
Fischer voted for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. She voted against Chuck Hagel's nomination as Secretary of Defense. She voted against expanding background checks for gun buyers and other gun control measures.

**VoteMatch**   
  
** Prioritize green energy **

**POSITIONS**

  * **Strongly ****Support** means you believe: Overuse of fossil fuels causes serious problems that we should deal with immediately by raising carbon taxes, raising CAFE standards, federally funding research into alternative and sustainable energy resources, and push to imlpement the Kyoto Protocol. 
  * **Support** means you believe: We should establish a market-based solution for excess carbon emissions, and the problem will be solved. The Kyoto Protocol should require developing countries' participation to make the solution work. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe: The cost of dealing with global warming is far higher than the potential damage, so we should do nothing. There's some evidence for global warming, but the effects are not certain. We should perhaps sign on to some international agreements, but make only minimal financial commitments for now. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe: There's no such thing as global warming - it's all natural climatic variation. And if there is a problem, it won't affect us much, and we can deal with the problems as they arise. 

This question is looking for your views on the use of carbon-based energy
sources in general.  However you answer the above question would be similar to
your response to these statements:

  * Spend Resources to Stop Global Warming 
  * Institute a Carbon Tax or increase the gasoline tax. 
  * Climate change is a serious problem that should be dealt with now. 
  * Implement the Kyoto Protocol and the Greenhouse Gas treaty. 
  * Generally those who answer positively to those questions will also answer positively on these environmental statements: 
  * Spend resources on pollution control and on achieving clean air and clean water. 
  * Support and expand the Endangered Species Act. 
  * We do not include nuclear energy in the question text because it muddies the water in the discussion about reducing carbon-based energy sources. Some who supoprt the Kyoto Protocol favor nuclear energy, and others claim the problems of its waste products outweight its global warming benefits. 
How do you decide between "Support" and "Strongly Support" when you agree with
both the descriptions above? (Or between "Oppose" and "Strongly Oppose"). The
strong positions are generally based on matters of **PRINCIPLES** where the
regular support and oppose positions are based on **PRACTICAL** matters. If
you answer "No Opinion," this question is not counted in the VoteMatch answers
for any candidate. If you give a general answer of Support vs. Oppose,
VoteMatch can more accurately match a candidate with your stand. Don't worry
so much about getting the strength of your answer exactly refined, or to think
too hard about the exact wording of the question -- like candidates!

  * **Strongly Support** means you believe in the **principle** that the earth has limited resources. 
  * **Support** means you believe in **practical** reasons for reduction in carbon usage, such as US technological competitiveness or reducing the risks of global warming. 
  * **Oppose** means you believe that **practical** cost considerations preclude taking action now. 
  * **Strongly Oppose** means you believe that the **principle** of global warming is false, or an exaggerated scare-mongering tactic. 

  
****BACKGROUND**

**Domestic Energy**
  * The 2012 election debates how to decrease imported energy -- with Democrats focusing on alternative energy and Republicans focusing on increased domestic production of fossil fuels. 

  * **_Cap-and-Trade**_: refers to a carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions policy where the amount of CO2 is "capped" at a government-specified emission amount, and then the right to emit CO2 is "traded" via emission permits. The result would be instituting a new fee for emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A similar program was used successfully to battle acid rain via sulfur dioxide emission permits trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 

  * **_CO2**_:  refers to carbon dioxide, the single largest greenhouse gas, but there are numerous other greenhouse gases too. Because CO2 has become so politicized, especially opposition to "Cap-and-Trade" and the Kyoto Protocol, many environmentalists have begun focusing on reducing other greenhouse gases, such as methane, as more politically achievable. 

  * **_OCS**_: refers to drilling for oil off the Outer Continental Shelf, several miles offshore. States control oil drilling in waters up to three miles offshore; the federal government controls waters from that distance until the continental shelf ends and the deep ocean begins (a maximum of about 350 miles offshore). Conservatives favor OCS drilling to reach more potential oil reserves; liberals cite the greater technical challenges and the higher risk of oil spills. 

  * **_Carbon sequestration**_: refers to removing CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere and keeping it "sequestered," or captured and stored, in a way that the CO2 cannot return to the atmosphere. Nature performs the simplest form of carbon sequestration: growing trees, which convert CO2 into wood. Human methods include chemical processes; burying CO2 underground; or mineralization (converting to carbonate rocks). 

  * **_Clean coal**_: refers to implementing methods for carbon capture and storage at coal-burning plants. Sequestering CO2 from coal plants involves filtering smokestack emissions (called "CO2 scrubbing"); capturing CO2 gas; and chemical conversion into stable solids. As of 2012, some smokestack experiments successfully demonstrate the techniques, but none are yet in commercial use. 

  * Domestic production advocate often cite "**_The Marcellus Shale**_", a natural-gas-rich formation under New York and the Appalachians -- it requires separating the gas from rock and methane. 

  * Other **_shale-gas**_ deposits are currently estimated to total 827 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, an equivalent to all of Saudi Arabia's oil. Members of both parties -- including Pres. Obama -- cite the potential of shale gas. 

  * Separating the natural gas requires "**_fracking**_", which uses large quantities of toxins, sand, and water; dealing with millions of gallons of toxic wastewater is the biggest side-effect. 

  * **_Solyndra**_: The Obama administration gave the solar panel company Solyndra a $500 million in federal loan guarantees; that company ended up bankrupt, hence costing the taxpayers $500M. In 2011, the GOP presidential primary contenders cited this issue often. 

  * **_Fracking**_ is short for hydraulic fracturing, a process used in 90% of natural gas wells. Fracking injects fluid underground at high pressure to fracture rock and release oil or gas trapped inside the formation. The champions of natural gas promote it as a clean energy alternative, but opponents note that fracking fluid is laced with toxic chemicals that have not been fully tested or disclosed to the public. New research (June 2012) indicates that fracking has a low risk of triggering earthquakes, 

  * Mitt Romney pushes for opening new nuclear plants, as a carbon-free alternative to energy needs. At issue is the ability (or inability) of the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to open new nuclear plants. The last new nuclear plant to come on-line in the US was in 1996, due to both political and economic issues. Pres. Obama promoted new nuclear plants during as part of a comprehensive energy plan; the NRC accordingly approved a new nuclear plant design in Dec. 2011, the first in decades 
**Gas Crisis**
  * **_$4 gas:**_ Gasoline spiked to record high levels over $4 per gallon in the summer of 2008, forcing energy issues to the forefront of the election. 
  * **_Gas Tax Holiday:**_ Politicians focused on the short-term economic pain caused by high gas prices, and called for a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax to drive down prices. Sen. John McCain and Sen. Hillary Clinton both called for a summer gas tax holiday, but Sen. Barack Obama called that a short-term "gimmick". High gas prices have stimulated high interest in fuel-efficient vehicles and have made hybrid vehicles cost-effective, while also stimulating record levels of ridership on mass transit systems. 
  * **_Offshore Drilling:**_ Congress banned new offshore drilling in 1981, but in Aug. 2008 Pres. Bush called for a restart of drilling. It is still pending Congressional action, but has become central to the political debate on energy. Democrats argue that million of acres offshore are available but undrilled (true, but the oil companies would prefer the more likely new areas). Republicans argue that high gas prices mean we need to "Drill here & drill now" (irrelevant, since offshore drilling takes years before the first delivery). 
  * **_Drill, baby, drill:**_ The mantra of the 2008 Republican National Convention is a political statement more than an economic statement, because of the long lag time between drilling and its effect on actual oil prices. The mantra, most associated with Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin, implies that one supports domestic oil & gas production, over developing alternative energy supplies, and especially over continuing to import foreign oil. 
  * **_Energy Independence:**_ Both liberals and conservatives favor the US becoming less dependent on foreign oil supplies. The key difference is in what would replace those foreign oil supplies. Conservatives focus on replacing them with domestic oil supplies, while liberals focus on replacing them with non-fossil fuels. 
  * **_Nuclear energy:**_ Sen. John McCain has pushed for opening several dozen new nuclear plants, as a carbon-free alternative to energy needs. The last new nuclear plant to come on-line in the US was in 1996, due to both political and economic issues. 
  * **_Yucca Mountain:**_ Since the 1980s, the federal government has been "studying" Yucca Mountain in Nevada as a permanent repository for nuclear waste. Yucca Mountain, about 80 miles from the Las Vegas, is called the "deep geological repository storage facility" because the radioactive waste would be buried deep in a mountain for the thousands of years that it remains dangerous. Delays have plagued the opening of Yucca Mountain because of its political controversy. The latest issue is how nuclear waste would be transported to Yucca Mountain, since it would travel by truck through other states in secret.  Congress canceled the program under President Obama in April 2011. 
  * **_Cellulosic Ethanol:**_ Ethanol as a fuel source has been increasing, primarily due to political pressure from farming states (ethanol is made from corn crops). Quantities of ethanol production for fuel have been high enough to drive food prices higher, so now the political pressure is to switch to non-food-based ethanol. Hence "cellulosic ethanol" replaces corn-based ethanol with ethanol from non-edible sources such as woodchips, switchgrass, and cornstalks. Environmentalists point out that the production of corn-based ethanol requires almost as much energy as the fuel that results from the production -- hence they view corn-based ethanol as having mixed value for global warming. "Biofuels" is the more general term for using biological sources to make ethanol for fuel; it includes both cellulosic ethanol and corn-based ethanol. 
  * **_Strategic Petroleum Reserve:**_ (SPR): Since the 1970s gas crises, the federal governmnet has been stockpiling oil in four underground caverns in Texas & Louisiana. The supply as of July 2008 is 700 million barrels, or about 33 days of the total US consumption. In July 2008, Congress suspended filling the SPR, to put downward pressure on gas prices. Congress could order sales from the SPR, for further downward price pressure -- the last SPR sale was in 2005 in response to Hurricane Katrina. 
  * **_Oil Refineries:**_ Many politicians call for allowing new oil refineries to be built in the US. No new oil refineries have been built in the US since 1976 (though many have been expanded). The difficulties and cost are primarily for compliance with EPA regulations; hence calling for new oil refineries implies relaxing EPA regulations.  
**Energy Issues**
  * **_ANWR:**_ The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a protected area in northern Alaska that contains substantial supplies of oil and gas. Conservatives favor drilling ANWR to extract the oil, while liberals favor maintaining its protected status. 
  * **_Deregulation Crisis:**_ California suffered rolling blackouts in 2001 due to insufficient energy supplies. California had partially deregulated its energy industry, by freeing retail prices, but maintaining controls on wholesale prices. Conservatives favor full deregulation and/or building more energy supply as a solution; liberals favor conservation and better regulation of energy delivery systems. 
  * **_Energy Conservation:**_ Americans are by far the least energy-efficient people in the industrialized world, primarily due to the heavy reliance on personal automobiles. Liberals favor ongoing efforts toward conservation, via more efficient automobiles and appliances, as well as voluntary usage restrictions; the goal is to avoid the need for additional energy imports or oil drilling. 
  * **_Alternative Energy:**_ The federal government regularly funds research into solar power, wind power, wave power, biomass power, and other alternative energy sources, but none are competitively priced with gas and oil at the present time. Liberals contend that gas and oil prices are kept artificially low by federal intervention (including military action in the Mideast), which results in policy prescriptions like President Clintons proposed BTU Tax in the early 1990s, intended to foster alternative energy development. 
  * **_CAFE standard:**_ The Corporate Average Fuel Economy requires that all automobile manufacturers maintain an average of 28 miles per gallon (mpg) for all vehicles sold. 
**Global Warming**
  * **_Greenhouse gases:**_ Atmospheric gases which keep heat in, like greenhouse glass does. The most common greenhouse gas (GHG) is carbon dioxide (CO2), which comes from burning gasoline, wood, oil, etc. The evidence of rising CO2 levels is undisputed; the political dispute centers on how much of the rise is attributable to human activities versus how much is natural climatic fluctuation. 
  * **_Global Warming:**_ Increase in worldwide temperature due to excess emissions of greenhouse gases. A few degrees rise in temperature, in theory, would cause rising sea levels, more extreme weather, and climate change around the world. The evidence of rising temperatures is undisputed; the political dispute centers on and whether it will change the climate and whether we can or should do something about it. 
  * **_Climate Change Treaty:**_ The basic international treaty on reducing greenhouse gas emissions was signed by the US and 182 other countries in 1992. It set up a framework for later protocols. Also known as the Rio Treaty or Greenhouse Gas Treaty. 
  * **_Kyoto Protocol:**_ The follow-up to the Climate Change Treaty which sets GHG reduction targets for the US and other developed countries. Completed in 1998, the US has not yet signed (Argentina is the largest economy to have signed). This is politically controversial because it would require the US to cut CO2 emissions, which is potentially costly. 
  * **_Effects on the US:**_ A Congressional national assessment on climate change, published in June 2000, predicts: 
    * An average temperature rise of 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit, with gentler winters and more summer heat waves.
    * More agricultural production and forest growth due to carbon dioxide fertilization; but loss of coastal wetlands and Alpine meadows.
    * More winter rain, with a 10% increase in overall precipitation, but a 60% increase in the Southwest.
    * More extreme storms and more pollution runoff due to rainstorms.
    * More drought in the Midwest, especially in Kansas and Colorado; and a 5-foot drop in Great Lakes water levels.
